" J"," Usselman, Melvyn C.Brown, Todd A."," Atomic Theory and Multiple Combining Proportions: The Search for WholeNumber Ratios Essay in Honour of Alan J. Rocke"," ANNALS OF SCIENCE"," John Dalton's atomic theory, with its postulate of compound formationthrough atom-to-atom combination, brought a new perspective to weightrelationships in chemical reactions. A presumed one-to-one combinationof atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton toconstruct his first table of relative atomic weights from literatureanalyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binarycompounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theoryas an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compoundsof the form AB(2), however, atomic theory made quantitative predictionsthat were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory requiredthat the weight of B in the compound AB(2) be exactly twice that in thecompound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston allpublished within a few years of each other experimental data thatclaimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. Thereare nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desiredintegral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replicationexperiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results areexperimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explainswhy Wollaston's experiments were so influential."," 10.1080/00033790.2015.1007522"," 2015"

This paper presents the prototype's passivestrategies, active systems and performance results. The limitations,future perspectives and potential for replicability and transposition ofSolark I are also discussed. Through a whole-building design process,Solark I effectively integrates all aspects of weather data analysis,building design, building envelope design, photovoltaic system design,solar hot water system design and heating, ventilating, and airconditioning system design to minimize energy consumption andenvironmental impacts. Solark I achieved an excellent balance betweenpassive strategies and highly efficient active systems. These designdecisions help Solark I to maintain its hydrothermal comfort and performall regular tasks with minimum energy consumption. This low energyconsumption allows Solark I to obtain a positive energy balance both inannual energy simulations and on-site during the monitored period."," 10.1080/00038628.2015.1011075"," 2015"

The question arises, however, whetherWestern concepts and questionnaires are transferable to societies withdifferent cultures. The aim of this study was to investigate theinstrument structure and the reliability of the Arabic version of theZuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-medium ( ZKPQ-m).Methods: Three statistical methods with decreased amount of strictnesswere used to analyse our data: Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Procrustesrotation and Principal Component Analysis.Results: Our outcomes did not confirm the original instrument structure.Instead, we found four interpretable components: Emotional Instability,Impulse-seeking, Activeness and Self-Control. However, the amount ofexplained variance was not very high and the internal consistenciesranged from unsatisfactory to only moderate. The data showed a highpercentage of respondents agreeing with more than three items of theInfrequency scale, which may be attributable to the collectivisticculture in Saudi Arabia.Conclusion: We did not succeed in replicating the ZKPQ structure in theArabic context. Social desirability, a common characteristic incollectivistic cultures, may have reduced the replicability of theinternal structure of the ZKPQ-m.

Large-scale genome-wide association(GWA) analyses of adult height in Europeans have identified nearly 180genetic loci. A recent study showed high replicability of results fromEuropeans-based GWA studies in Asians; however, population-specific locimay exist due to distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. We carriedout a GWA meta-analysis in 93 926 individuals from East Asia. Weidentified 98 loci, including 17 novel and 81 previously reported loci,associated with height at P<5x10(-8), together explaining 8.89% ofphenotypic variance. Among the newly identified variants, 10 arecommonly distributed (minor allele frequency, MAF > 5%) in Europeans,with comparable frequencies with in Asians, and 7single-nucleotidepolymorphisms are with low frequency (MAF <5%) in Europeans. Inaddition, our data suggest that novel biological pathway such as theprotein tyrosine phosphatase family is involved in regulation of height.The findings from this study considerably expand our knowledge of thegenetic architecture of human height in Asians."," 10.1093/hmg/ddu583"," 2015"

The first suggested change encouragingtransparency and replication is clearly worthwhile, but we question thewisdom of the second suggested change: abandoning p-values in favor ofreporting confidence intervals (CIs) only in all psychological researchreports. This article has three goals. First, we correct the falseimpression created by Cumming that the debate about the usefulness ofNHST has been won by its critics. Second, we take issue with the impliedconnection between the use of NHST and the current crisis ofreplicability in psychology. Third, while we agree with other critics ofCumming (2014) that hypothesis testing is an important part of science(Morey et al., 2014), we express skepticism that alternative hypothesistesting frameworks, such as Bayes factors, are a solution to thereplicability crisis. Poor methodological practices can compromise thevalidity of Bayesian and classic statistical analyses alike. When itcomes to choosing between competing statistical approaches, we highlightthe value of applying the same standards of evidence that psychologistsdemand in choosing between competing substantive hypotheses."," 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00245"," 2015"

Moreover, several dependability recommendationspropose practices to address the problem of false positive findings thatcan inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and viceversa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to developa concise and concrete list of core research dependabilityrecommendations that address problems of false positive and falsenegative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of thecurrent research dependability literature and earlier literaturesdealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set ofthree core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct andpromote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing whenrequested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truthseeking mindset during the research endeavor."," 10.1037/gpr0000028"," 2015"
" J"," Pyeon, DohunPark, In-Woo"," Interaction between Nef and INI1/SMARCB1 augments replicability of HIV-1in resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells"," ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY"," A central feature of HIV-1 infection is the inability of entering virusto integrate into chromosomes of resting T lymphocytes unless they aremitogenically activated. In contrast, SIVpbj1.9 replicates in initiallyresting T lymphocytes by activating infected cells. Previous reportshave shown that a difference in Nef-mediated T cell activation betweenHIV-1 and SIVpbj1.9 plays a critical role in the differing abilities ofthese viruses to replicate in resting lymphocytes. However, themolecular details of these differences are still unclear. Here, we showthat infection with a chimeric virus, HSIVnef, which harbors the 5' 308nucleotides of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5' 221 nucleotides of HIV-1nef in the HIV-1 proviral backbone, resulted in integration of theprovirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and therebyreplication in resting human PBMCs (hPBMCs). These results indicate thatNef is an essential viral determinant for the integration of provirusinto host chromosomes in resting T cells. Using the yeast two-hybridsystem, we identified integrase interactor-1 (INI1/SMARCB1) as acellular factor that is involved in the integration process viainteraction with Nef. Although INI1 interacted with both SIVpbj1.9 andHIV-1 Nefs, SIVpbj1.9 Nef, but not HIV-1 Nef, enhanced proviralintegration into host DNA. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealedthat the basic-amino-acid-rich amino-terminal domain in SIVpbj1.9 Nef iscrucial for interaction with INI1 and virus replication in restinghPBMCs. Taken together, these data indicate that Nef is a critical viralprotein for incorporating nascent proviral DNA into host chromosomes inresting PBMCs and that this occurs through interaction with INI1. Thiselucidates the basis for replication of the integrated provirus when thehost cell is in a resting state."," 10.1007/s00705-014-2315-9"," 2015"

Food security, edible insects, and ""One World, OneHealth"" collaboration."," Social science & medicine (1982)"," Scientists in the Netherlands are cultivating edible insects to addressconcerns of international food security. Committed to the One World, OneHealth (OWOH) movement, their research aims to create a safe andeffective global solution to the conjoined problems of climate changeand an increasing worldwide demand for protein. Their preliminary workis promising, as it suggests that when compared to other sources ofmeat, insects can be an efficient, safe, and low-impact source ofnutrients. Additionally, in many sites with endemic malnutrition, peoplefind insects tasty. The problem these scientists are grappling with,however, is that insects that are easily mass-produced are not theinsects people typically want to eat. This paper shows how thecontingency of edibility complicates existing scientific models oftravel that posit that singular objects spread peripherally outwardsfrom a center into a globally connected, singular world. The scientistsare finding that the production of successful food products necessitatesthat insects be constantly tinkered with: there is no ""insect"" that canbe globally edible since ""the global"" itself is not a singular entity.This in turn complicates the vision of replicability and ""scaling up""inherent in an OWOH vision of science. The researchers' process ofmoving their goods from the laboratory boxes they work with into themealtime practices they seek to impact is compelling them to cultivateand articulate new ideals for research, methods of translation, andpathways by which goods can travel.

Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differsfrom classic autism in that in AS there is no language or generalcognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors areimplicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity andneurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility toASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) geneencodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes,neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia. A mutation inthis gene has been identified in individuals with ASC and singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been nominally associated with ASand autistic traits in previous studies.Methods: In this study, we tested 34 SNPs in ARNT2 for association withAS in 118 cases and 412 controls of Caucasian origin. P values wereadjusted for multiple comparisons, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) amongthe SNPs analysed was calculated in our sample. Finally, SNP annotationallowed functional and structural analyses of the genetic variants inARNT2. We tested the replicability of our result using the genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) database of the Psychiatric GenomicsConsortium (PGC).Results: We report statistically significant association of rs17225178with AS. This SNP modifies transcription factor binding sites andregions that regulate the chromatin state in neural cell lines. It isalso included in a LD block in our sample, alongside other geneticvariants that alter chromatin regulatory regions in neural cells.Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that rs17225178 in the ARNT2gene is associated with AS and support previous studies that pointed outan involvement of this gene in the predisposition to ASC."," 10.1186/s13229-015-0009-0"," 2015"

Evaluations of microcosm/mesocosm studiesrely heavily on no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) calculated fordifferent population-level endpoints. Ideally, a power analysis shouldbe reported for the concentration-response relationships underlyingthese NOECs, as well as for measurement endpoints for which significanteffects cannot be demonstrated. An indication of this statistical powercan be provided a posteriori by calculated minimum detectabledifferences (MDDs). The MDD defines the difference between the means ofa treatment and the control that must exist to detect a statisticallysignificant effect. The aim of this paper is to expand on the AquaticGuidance Document recently published by the European Food SafetyAuthority (EFSA) and to propose a procedure to report and evaluate NOECsand related MDDs in a harmonised way. In addition, decision schemes areprovided on how MDDs can be used to assess the reliability ofmicrocosm/mesocosm studies and for the derivation of effect classes usedto derive regulatory acceptable concentrations.

Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability,because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods havenot been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paperdescribes how two independent teams of researchers attempted toreproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, ""Shrinkageestimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect onforecasting accuracy"" (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceededsystematically, reporting results both before and after receivingclarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams wereable to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those ofMiller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in theconclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal dampingoutperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecastingmethods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach tomethod documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code,as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitionersand researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in itslessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in itsapproach to the reproduction of forecasting research.

Much research work has studied the application ofgamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement andresults of developers.Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematicmapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in anattempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifyinggaps and opportunities for further research.Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding theprimary studies in the existing literature, which were later classifiedand analyzed according to four criteria: the software process areaaddressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research methodfollowed, and the type of forum in which they were published. Asubjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluatethem in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with theorganization, and replicability.Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primarystudies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of themfocus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements,project management, and other support areas. In the main, they considervery simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and fewprovide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, andmore research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would beneeded. Future research work should look at other game mechanics inaddition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas thathave not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management,maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodologicalsupport that would make their proposals replicable in other settings.The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools isalso an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field.

Neither short-termhumanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adaptedfor such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work bestwhen national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aidmodalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 andtheir results and implications. Literature review and case experiencewas utilised.Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries in non-contestedsectors to determine local priorities rather than following globalprescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather than deliveringthrough fragmented projects, and building on national systems andcapacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the TransitionFund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in partnershipwith the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important results inhealth, education, social support and water services in a challengingsetting. In addition, forums for collaboration were developed thatprovided a platform for further action. The initial emphasis on servicedelivery diffused much of the political delicateness that impededprogress in other sectors. The Zimbabwean experience may provide a modelof innovative financing for countries facing similar circumstances.Summary: Such models may represent a new practical application of theParis Principles, consistent with the major tenets of the 2011 New Dealfor Engagement in Fragile States agreed in Busan. As we approach theMillennium Development Goal deadline, an over-arching, mutli-sectoraland independent evaluation of this approach is recommended in order tovalidate findings and assess broader replicability of this approach."," 10.1186/s12914-014-0035-6"," 2014"

The IPIP-NEO is free to use and can bemodified to accommodate its users' needs. Despite the substantialinterest in this measure, there is still a dearth of data demonstratingits convergence with the NEO PI-R. The present study represents aninvestigation of the reliability and validity of scores on the IPIP-NEO.Additionally, we used item response theory (IRT) methodology to create a120-item version of the IPIP-NEO. Using an undergraduate sample (n =359), we examined the reliability, as well as the convergent andcriterion validity, of scores from the 300-item IPIP-NEO, a previouslyconstructed 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO (Johnson, 2011), and thenewly created IRT-based IPIP-120 in comparison to the NEO PI-R across arange of outcomes. Scores from all 3 IPIP measures demonstrated strongreliability and convergence with the NEO PI-R and a high degree ofsimilarity with regard to their correlational profiles across thecriterion variables (r(ICC) = .983,.972, and .976, respectively). Thereplicability of these findings was then tested in a community sample (n= 757), and the results closely mirrored the findings from Sample 1.These results provide support for the use of the IPIP-NEO and both120-item IPIP-NEO measures as assessment tools for measurement of thefive-factor model."," 10.1037/pas0000004"," 2014"

The objectives of thisstudy were to develop, improve and validate a scale independent biomassmodel. Field studies were conducted in Huimin County, Shandong Provinceof China, during the 2006-2007 growing season of winter wheat (Triticumaestivum L). The field design had a multiscale set-up with four levelswhich differed in their management, such as nitrogen fertilizer inputsand cultivars, to create different biomass conditions: smallexperimental fields (L1), large experimental fields (L2), small farmfields (L3), and large farm fields (L4). L4, planted with differentwinter wheat varieties, was managed according to farmers' practice whileLi through L3 represented controlled field experiments. Multitemporalspectral measurements were taken in the fields, and biomass was sampledfor each spectral campaign. In addition, multitemporal Hyperion datawere obtained in 2006 and 2007. Li field data were used to developbiomass models based on the relation between the winter wheat spectraand biomass: several published vegetation indices, including NRI, REP,OSAVI, TCI, and NDVI, were investigated. A new hyperspectral vegetationindex, which uses a four-band combination in the NIR and SWIR domains,named GnyLi, was developed. Following the multiscale concept, the dataof higher levels (L2 through L4) were used stepwise to validate andimprove the models of the lower levels, and to transfer the improvedmodels to the next level. Lastly, the models were transferred andvalidated at the regional scale using Hyperion images of 2006 and 2007.The results showed that the GnyLi and NRI models, which were based onthe NIR and SWIR domains, performed best with R-2 > 0.74. All the otherindices explained less than 60% model variability. Using the Hyperiondata for regionalization, GnyLi and NRI explained 81-89% of the biomassvariability. These results highlighted that GnyLi and NRI can be usedtogether with hyperspectral images for both plot and regional levelbiomass estimation. Nevertheless, additional studies and analyses areneeded to test its replicability in other environmental conditions. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."," 10.1016/j.jag.2014.05.006"," 2014"

RNA isknown to feature two of the three essential functions of living entities(metabolism, heredity and membrane): it is capable of unlimited heredityand it has a proven capacity for catalysing very different chemicalreactions which may form simple metabolic networks. The MetabolicallyCoupled Replicator System is a class of simulation models built on thesetwo functions to show that an RNA World scenario for the origin of lifeis ecologically feasible, provided that it is played on mineralsurfaces. The fact that RNA templates and their copies are ofcomplementary base sequences has an obvious dynamical relevance:complementary strains may have very different structures and,consequently, functions - one may specialize for increasing enzymaticactivity while the other takes the role of the gene of the enzyme.Results: Incorporating the functional divergence of template and copyinto the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System model framework we showthat sequence complementarity 1) does not ruin the coexistence of a setof metabolically cooperating replicators; 2) the replicator systemremains resistant to, but also tolerant with its parasites; 3) opens theway to the evolutionary differentiation of phenotype and genotypethrough a primitive version of phenotype amplification.Conclusions: The functional asymmetry of complementary RNA strainsresults in a shift of phenotype/genotype (enzyme/gene) proportions inMCRS, favouring a slight genotype dominance. This asymmetry is expectedto reverse due to the evolved trade-off of high ""gene"" replicability andhigh catalytic activity of the corresponding ""enzyme"" in expense of itsreplicability. This trade-off is the first evolutionary step towards the""division of labour"" among enzymes and genes, which has concluded in theextreme form of phenotype amplification characteristic of our recentDNA-RNA protein World."," 10.1186/s12862-014-0234-8"," 2014"

We analyze theapplicability of QT to two basic properties in opinion polling. Thefirst property (response replicability) is that, for a large class ofquestions, a response to a given question is expected to be repeated ifthe question is posed again, irrespective of whether another question isasked and answered in between. The second property (question ordereffect) is that the response probabilities frequently depend on theorder in which the questions are asked. Whenever these two propertiesoccur together, it poses a problem for QT. The conventional QT withHermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in theway incompatible with the question order effect. In the generalizationof QT known as theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), inorder to account for response replicability, the POVMs involved must beconventional operators. Although these problems are not unique to QT andalso challenge conventional cognitive theories, they stand out asimportant unresolved problems for the application of QT to cognition.Either some new principles are needed to determine the bounds ofapplicability of QT to cognition, or quantum formalisms more generalthan POVMs are needed."," 10.1371/journal.pone.0110909"," 2014"

Here we propose atask-optimized spatial filtering strategy for uncovering individualmagnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to audiobook stories. Tensubjects listened to 1-h-long recording once, as well as to 48repetitions of a 1-min-long speech passage. Employing responsereplicability as statistical validity and utilizing unsupervisedlearning methods, we trained spatial filters that were able togeneralize over datasets of an individual. For thisblind-signal-separation (BSS) task, we derived a version of multi-setsimilarity-constrained canonical correlation analysis (SimCCA) thattheoretically provides maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in thissetting. Irrespective of significant noise in unaveraged MEG traces, themethod successfully uncovered feasible time courses up to similar to 120Hz, with the most prominent signals below 20 Hz. Individualtrial-to-trial correlations of such time courses reached the level of0.55 (median 0.33 in the group) at similar to 0.5 Hz, with considerablevariation between subjects. By this filtering, the SNR increased up to20 times. In comparison, independent component analysis (ICA) orprincipal component analysis (PCA) did not improve SNR notably. Thevalidity of the extracted brain signals was further assessed byinspecting their associations with the stimulus, as well as by mappingthe contributing cortical signal sources. The results indicate that theproposed methodology effectively reduces noise in MEG recordings to thatextent that brain responses can be seen to nonrecurring audiobookstories. The study paves the way for applications aiming at accuratelymodeling the stimulus-response-relationship by tackling the responsevariability, as well as for real-time monitoring of brain signals ofindividuals in naturalistic experimental conditions.

Potential trade-offs between remedial costs,environmental effects, human health risks, and societal benefits, aswell as fundamental differences in stakeholder priorities, complicatedecision making. Formal decision-analytic tools such as multicriteriadecision analysis (MCDA) move beyond ad hoc decision support toquantitatively and holistically rank management alternatives and addtransparency and replicability to the evaluation process. However, eventhe best decisions made under uncertainty may be found suboptimal inhindsight, once additional scientific, social, economic, or otherdetails become known. Value of information (VoI) analysis extends MCDAby systematically evaluating the impact of uncertainty on a decision.VoI prioritizes future research in terms of expected decision relevanceby helping decision makers estimate the likelihood that additionalinformation will improve decision confidence or change their selectionof a management plan. In this study, VoI analysis evaluates uncertainty,estimates decision confidence, and prioritizes research to informselection of a sediment capping strategy for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and-furan contaminated Grenland fiord system in southern Norway. The VoImodel extends stochastic MCDA to model decisions with and withoutsimulated new information and compares decision confidence acrossscenarios with different degrees of remaining uncertainty. Resultshighlight opportunities for decision makers to benefit from additionalinformation by anticipating the improved decision confidence (or lackthereof) expected from reducing uncertainties for each criterion orcombination of criteria. This case study demonstrates the usefulness ofVoI analysis for environmental decisions by predicting when decisionscan be made confidently, for prioritizing areas of research to pursue toimprove decision confidence, and for differentiating betweendecision-relevant and decision-irrelevant differences in evaluationperspectives, all of which help guide meaningful deliberation towardeffective consensus solutions."," 10.1021/es500717t"," 2014"

However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attemptresults in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes wepropose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic andholds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis thatpostulates a zero effect size, H-0 : delta=0. The 2nd hypothesis is thatof the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the onefound in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by aposterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis-the replicationhypothesis-is given by H-r : delta similar to ""posterior distributionfrom original study."" The weighted-likelihood ratio between H-0 and H-rquantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication successand failure. In addition to the new test, we present several otherBayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning areplication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions ofthe separate experiments, the difference in effect size between theoriginal experiment and the replication attempt, and the overallconclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesiantests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which theresult of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenonat hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3examples from the literature.

Contraryto previous studies, we observed a reduced pain tolerance in patientswith mild to moderate AD, which suggests that the reduced report of paincannot be explained by reduced processing of painful stimuli.

In this study, we investigated whether the removal ofoutliers in psychology papers is related to weaker evidence (against thenull hypothesis of no effect), a higher prevalence of reporting errors,and smaller sample sizes in these papers compared to papers in the samejournals that did not report the exclusion of outliers from theanalyses.Methods and Findings: We retrieved a total of 2667 statistical resultsof null hypothesis significance tests from 153 articles in mainpsychology journals, and compared results from articles in whichoutliers were removed (N = 92) with results from articles that reportedno exclusion of outliers (N = 61). We preregistered our hypotheses andmethods and analyzed the data at the level of articles. Results show nosignificant difference between the two types of articles in median pvalue, sample sizes, or prevalence of all reporting errors, largereporting errors, and reporting errors that concerned the statisticalsignificance. However, we did find a discrepancy between the reporteddegrees of freedom of t tests and the reported sample size in 41% ofarticles that did not report removal of any data values. This suggestscommon failure to report data exclusions (or missingness) inpsychological articles.Conclusions: We failed to find that the removal of outliers from theanalysis in psychological articles was related to weaker evidence(against the null hypothesis of no effect), sample size, or theprevalence of errors. However, our control sample might be contaminateddue to nondisclosure of excluded values in articles that did not reportexclusion of outliers.

SuchandNijhuis, Christian A."," Reversible Soft Top-Contacts to Yield Molecular Junctions with Preciseand Reproducible Electrical Characteristics"," ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS"," The reproducibility of the electrical characteristics of molecularjunctions has been notoriously low. This paper describes a method toconstruct tunnel junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) byforming reversible electrical contacts to SAMs using top-electrodes of anon-Newtonian liquid-metal (GaOx/EGaIn) stabilized in amicrofluidic-based device. A single top-electrode can be used to form upto 15-25 junctions. This method generates SAM-based junctions withhighly reproducible electrical characteristics in terms of precision(widths of distributions) and replicability (closeness to a referencevalue). The reason is that this method, unlike other approaches thatrely on cross-bar or nano/micropore configurations, does not requirepatterning of the bottom-electrodes and is compatible with ultra-flattemplate-stripped (TS) surfaces. This compatibly with non-patternedelectrodes is important for three reasons. i) No edges of the electrodesare present at which SAMs cannot pack well. ii) Patterning requiresphotoresist that may contaminate the electrode and complicate SAMformation. iii) TS-surfaces contain large grains, have low rms values,and can be obtained and used (in ordinary laboratory conditions) withina few seconds to minimize contamination. The junctions have very goodelectrical stability (2500 current-voltage cycles and retained currentsfor 27 h), and can be fabricated with good yields (approximate to 78%)."," 10.1002/adfm.201304237"," 2014"

Recent research using administrative claims datahas substantiated the prevalence and cost of opioid abuse amongcommercially insured individuals. Although administrative claims dataare readily available and have been used to effectively answer researchquestions about the burden of illness for many different conditions, animportant issue is the reliability, replicability, and generalizabilityof estimates derived from different databases. Therefore, this studysought to assess whether the findings of a recently published study ofopioid abuse in a commercial claims database (original analysis) couldbe replicated in a different commercial claims database. The originalanalysis, which analyzed the prevalence and excess health care costs ofdiagnosed opioid abuse in the OptumHealth Reporting and InsightsDatabase, was replicated by applying the same approach to the TruvenMarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (replicationanalysis). In the replication analysis, the prevalence of diagnosedopioid abuse increased steadily from 15.8 diagnosed opioid abusers per10 000 in 2009, to 26.6 diagnosed opioid abusers per 10 000 in 2012.Although the prevalence of diagnosed opioid abuse was higher thanreported in the original analysis, the trend of increasing prevalenceover time was consistent across analyses. Additionally, diagnosedabusers had excess annual per patient health care costs of $ 11 376 inthe replication analysis, which was consistent with the excess annualper patient health care costs of diagnosed abuse of $ 10 627 reported inthe original analysis. The replication analysis also found an upwardtrend in the prevalence of diagnosed opioid abuse over time andsubstantial excess annual per patient health care costs of diagnosedopioid abuse among commercially insured individuals, suggesting thatthese findings are generalizable to other commercially insuredpopulations."," 10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2783"," 2014"

This is shown by some studies, the authors of which havefound high percentages of researchers who falsify their CV or manipulatedata. We analyze the system used to evaluate science and researchers,which is almost exclusively based on the impact factor. We review themain critiques on the inappropriate use of the impact factor to assessresearchers and argue that this has generated a new style of thinking inwhich the only goal is to obtain publications with an impact factor.Over the last few years, the pressure to publish has led to an obsessionamong researchers to disseminate the multiple indicators of theirscientific publications over the Internet, to the extent that suchinitiatives look like marketing campaigns where researchers advertisethemselves. For all these reasons, we propose that this may be a newpsychological disorder, given that several criteria indicatingmaladaptation are clearly met: falsification and/or manipulation ofdata, falsification of publication indicators, distortion of reality,belief in manipulated data, and an obsession to conduct marketingcampaigns of oneself. We address the important ethical and legalimplications of such falsifications.

Hierarchical cluster analyses were used tolook for combinations of single facial actions in episodes of pain. Thestability/replicability of facial activity patterns was determinedacross samples as well as across different basic social situations.ResultsCluster analyses revealed four distinct activity patterns duringpain, which stably occurred across samples and situations: (I) narrowedeyes with furrowed brows and wrinkled nose; (II) opened mouth withnarrowed eyes; (III) raised eyebrows; and (IV) furrowed brows withnarrowed eyes. In addition, a considerable number of participants werefacially completely unresponsive during pain induction (stoic cluster).These activity patterns seem to be reaction stereotypies in the majorityof individuals (in nearly two-thirds), whereas a minority displayedvarying clusters across situations.ConclusionThese findings suggest that there is no uniform set of facialactions but instead there are at least four different facial activitypatterns occurring during pain that are composed of differentconfigurations of facial actions.

Data were collectedfor six independent standard setting exercises, with three panelsparticipating in each exercise. The results show that although in somecases the panel effect is negligible, for four of the six data sets thepanel facet represented a large portion of the overall error variance.Ignoring the often hidden panel/occasion facet can result inartificially optimistic estimates of the cut score stability. Resultsbased on a single panel should not be viewed as a reasonable estimate ofthe results that would be found over multiple panels.

The ten SPA projects reviewed performed highest overall,especially with regards to efficiency, legitimacy, and replicability.The five SCCF projects performed the highest in equity, flexibility, andsustainability, and the three NAPA-related projects were thehighest-performing projects with regards to effectiveness. A comparisonof top-down and bottom-up approaches revealed that community stakeholderengagement in project design and implementation led to highereffectiveness, efficiency, equity, flexibility, legitimacy,sustainability, and replicability. Although low institutional capacityconstrained both project success and effective community participation,projects that hired international staff to assist in implementationexperienced higher overall performance. These case studies alsoillustrate how participatory methods can fail to genuinely empower orinvolve communities in adaptation interventions in both top-down andbottom-up approaches. It is thus crucial to carefully considerstakeholder engagement strategies in adaptation interventions.PolicyrelevanceWhile adaptation is now firmly on the policy and researchagenda, actual interventions to reduce vulnerability and enhanceresilience remain in their infancy, and there is limited information onthe factors that influence the successful implementation of adaptationin developing areas. Engaging stakeholders in assessing vulnerabilityand implementing adaptation interventions is widely regarded to be animportant factor for adaptation implementation and success. However, nostudy has evaluated the effects of stakeholder engagement in the actualimplementation of adaptation initiatives. Effective stakeholderengagement is challenging, especially in a developing nation setting,due to high levels of poverty, inadequate knowledge on adaptationoptions, weak institutions, and competing interests to address moreimmediate problems related to poverty and underdevelopment. In thiscontext, this article documents and characterizes stakeholder engagementin adaptation interventions supported through the GEF, examining howtop-down or bottom-up stakeholder approaches enable or constrain projectperformance."," 10.1080/14693062.2014.859501"," 2014"

(2009) investigated the ability ofpigs (Sus scrofa) to use a mirror to locate a hidden food source. Themirror-experienced pigs appeared to be able to bypass a solid barrierthat blocked direct view of a food bowl when the food bowl could be seenvia a mirror. We tried to replicate these findings using 2 groups of 11piglets each. The procedure used for testing the first group of 11 pigsfollowed Broom's description as closely as possible. Only two of thepigs of the first group were able to locate the hidden food bowl duringthe mirror test. Therefore, measures were taken to increase the numberof pigs noticing the mirror in the second group of 11 pigs. Now,although pigs notice the mirror significantly earlier, only 1 of themirror-experienced pigs and none of the mirror-naive pigs used thedetour around the partition wall to reach the hidden food. We take thisobservation as evidence that the pigs did not understand what the mirrorimage represents, and did not use the mirror to locate food.

This raisesquestions about how researchers should interpret failed replicationattempts, given the large impact that even modest amounts of measurementerror can have on observed associations. In the second set ofsimulations, we illustrated the difficulties that researchers face whentrying to interpret and replicate a published finding. We also assessedthe relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error inproducing variability in replications. Conventionally, replicationattempts are viewed through the lens of verifying or falsifyingpublished findings. We suggest that this is a flawed perspective andthat researchers should adjust their expectations concerningreplications and shift to a meta-analytic mind-set."," 10.1177/1745691614528518"," 2014"
" J"," Perugini, MarcoGallucci, MarcelloCostantini, Giulio"," Safeguard Power as a Protection Against Imprecise Power Estimates"," PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE"," An essential first step in planning a confirmatory or a replicationstudy is to determine the sample size necessary to draw statisticallyreliable inferences using power analysis. A key problem, however, isthat what is available is the sample-size estimate of the effect size,and its use can lead to severely underpowered studies when the effectsize is overestimated. As a potential remedy, we introduce safeguardpower analysis, which uses the uncertainty in the estimate of the effectsize to achieve a better likelihood of correctly identifying thepopulation effect size. Using a lower-bound estimate of the effect size,in turn, allows researchers to calculate a sample size for a replicationstudy that helps protect it from being underpowered. We show that inmost common instances, compared with nominal power, safeguard power ishigher whereas standard power is lower. We additionally recommend theuse of safeguard power analysis to evaluate the strength of the evidenceprovided by the original study."," 10.1177/1745691614528519"," 2014"

Combined with thelow power of most current work, this often leads to the use ofmisleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal(1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled thecontinuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA) approach. For example, aCCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significancemight nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect isreal. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that twostudies that differ in whether they are significant might have onlytrivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introductionto the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explainhow it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generallyto assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies.

While protection structuresmay help to reduce the level of hazard and the expected degree of loss,some danger of technical failures or human errors will always remain.For extreme events, the implementation of non-structural measures asearly warning systems and disaster management practices is required toensure the protection of population.During Theseus, a methodology for helping the local authorities toprepare an action plan in case of coastal flooding was developed andtested on the estuary of Gironde in France. The methodology builds overthe return of experience from past events and tries to clearly identifyall the stages of an evacuation and the thinking process that can leadto a robust evacuation plan. It relies on a conceptual framework -SADT-which helps to understand how data should be processed from itscollection to its use in the plan. The risk scenarios were calculatedfor current and future conditions of the XXIst century, taking intoaccount the effects of climate change. The methodology is supported bythe OSIRIS software, prototyped during the FP5 eponymous project andlater distributed by CETMEF and the French basin authorities of Loireand Meuse.The methodology for the preparation of evacuation plans was applied on apilot city of Theseus, Bordeaux on the estuary of Gironde (France), andthe software used to calculate evacuation times was tried out onCesenatico near the Adriatic coast (Italy). This comparison verified thereplicability of methodological guidelines in two different Europeancontexts. The cultural and organizational differences and the differentnumber of people involved underlined strong questions to be addressedwhen applying them. In order to assess the efficiency of an evacuationstrategy and to compute the number of people successfully evacuated overtime, a macroscopic model (not representing each individual vehicle butonly flows of vehicles in congestion points) for the simulation oftraffic congestion was used, based on the work of the University ofTwente, Rijkswaterstaat and INFRAM. This model will be integrated in theTheseus decision support system for helping coastal managers to selecttheir strategy for risk mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent advances inalgorithmics and statistics have enabled repeated exhaustive search forbivariate features in a practical amount of time using standardcomputational resources, allowing us to use cross-validation to evaluatethe stability. We performed 10 trials of 2-fold cross-validation ofexhaustive bivariate analysis on seven Wellcome-Trust Case-ControlConsortium GWAS datasets, comparing the traditional chi(2) test forassociation, the high-performance GBOOST method and the recentlyproposed GSS statistic (Available athttp://bioinformatics.research.nicta.com.au/software/gwis/). We useSpearman's correlation to measure the similarity between the folds ofcross validation. To compare incomplete lists of ranks we propose anextension to Spearman's correlation. The extension allows us to considera natural threshold for feature selection where the correlation is zero.This is the first reported cross-validation study of exhaustivebivariate GWAS feature selection. We found that stability between rankedlists from different cross-validation folds was higher for GSS in themajority of diseases. A thorough analysis of the correlation betweenSNP-frequency and univariate chi(2) score demonstrated that the chi(2)test for association is highly confounded by main effects: SNPs withhigh univariate significance replicably dominate the ranked results. Weshow that removal of the univariately significant SNPs improves chi(2)replicability but risks filtering pairs involving SNPs with univariateeffects. We empirically confirm that the stability of GSS and GBOOSTwere not affected by removal of univariately significant SNPs. Theseresults suggest that the GSS and GBOOST tests are successfully targetingbivariate association with phenotype and that GSS is able to reliablydetect a larger set of SNP-pairs than GBOOST in the majority of the datawe analysed.

Adult male offenders from twodistinct correctional settings (n=157 and 169) were investigated toensure replicability of findings across samples exhibiting high baserates of psychopathy and antisocial behavior.Results We found evidence for convergent and discriminant validity ofthe three triarchic facets in predicting symptomatic components ofpsychopathy as assessed by the PCL-R. Additionally, and cruciallyvis-a-vis current debates in the field, we found that boldnesscontributed incrementally (over and above disinhibition and meanness) toprediction of PCL-R psychopathy, in particular its interpersonal stylecomponent, but not ASPD.Conclusions The three distinct facets of the triarchic model ofpsychopathy are represented clearly and distinctly in the PCL-R, withboldness through its interpersonal facet, but not in DSM-defined ASPD.Our findings suggest that boldness is central to diagnostic conceptionsof psychopathy and distinguishes psychopathy from the more prevalentdiagnosis of ASPD."," 10.1017/S003329171300161X"," 2014"

In recent years they have invested in IPTV platforms andlaunched their own IPTV services. This has brought a new question on theregulatory agenda: shall network operators be obliged to offer wholesaleaccess to their IPTV platform? And if yes, should the new wholesale IPTVproduct be regulated in the same way as traditional wholesale access? Orshould traditional regulation be modified? While the majority ofcountries have so far no regulatory rules in place, some nationalregulators have started to become active in this market segment.In order for alternative network operators to realise multiple playoffers including IPTV they must be able to match the offers of theincumbent operators. Such replicability with respect to telecomsinfrastructure is in principle no problem as long as regulatory rules onlocal loop unbundling and related facilities are in place. But what ifincumbent operators are neither required to offer unbundled access totheir FTTH local loops nor do alternative network operators have accessto sub-loop unbundling? It is for this reason that many argue some formof direct access to the incumbent multicast equipment needs to beprovided. Otherwise the provision of IPTV services will be restricted tolarge network operators.The paper demonstrates that the regulation of wholesale access to IPTVdepends above all on country specific conditions. Ex-ante regulation ofaccess to wholesale broadband services over any DSL technology and anytransport technology (ATM and Ethernet) in the sense that the SMPoperator is obliged to offer a multicast functionality that allowscompetitors to offer TV services should be bound to a number ofrequirements: (1) the demand characteristics such as demand for bundledproducts. A precondition for determining regulatory obligations withrespect to the provision of wholesale access to IPTV platforms should bethat multiple play offers are the dominant form of providing telecomservices. (2) The lack of cable TV operators exerting competitivepressure at the retail level for triple play products. (3) A lack of LLUin the country, so that alternative operators need a multicast WBAaccess to offer multiple play services.The paper is organised as follows. The first section of the paperbriefly describes the technical and market characteristics of wholesaleIPTV access. The second section considers the impact of IPTV wholesaleaccess regulation on competition, investment and broadband diffusion.The third section examines regulatory issues concerning access towholesale IPTV in more detail.

Understanding theinterplay between genotype, phenotype and environment is necessary tomake accurate predictions of important biological outcomes such asstress resistance or yield in economically important plants and animals,and disease in humans. Based on population frequency patterns andfootprints of selection at the DNA level, the transposable elementBari-Jheh, inserted in the intergenic region of Juvenile Hormone EpoxyHydrolase (Jheh) genes, was previously identified as putativelyadaptive. However, the adaptive effect of this mutation remainedelusive. In this work, we integrate information on transcription factorbinding sites, available ChIP-Seq data, gene expression analyses andphenotypic assays to identify the functional and the mechanisticunderpinnings of Bari-Jheh. We show that Bari-Jheh adds extraantioxidant response elements upstream of Jheh1 and Jheh2 genes.Accordingly, we find that Bari-Jheh is associated with upregulation ofJheh1 and Jheh2 and with resistance to oxidative stress induced by twodifferent compounds relevant for natural D.melanogaster populations. Wefurther show that TEs other than Bari-Jheh might be playing a role inthe D.melanogaster response to oxidative stress. Overall our resultscontribute to the understanding of resistance to oxidative stress innatural populations and highlight the role of transposable elements inenvironmental adaptation. The replicability of fitness effects ondifferent genetic backgrounds also suggests that epistatic interactionsdo not seem to dominate the genetic architecture of oxidative stressresistance."," 10.1111/mec.12711"," 2014"

We demonstrate, usingrealistic simulations, that the average false discovery proportion ofour method remains small. We apply our method to six type two diabetes(T2D) GWA studies. Out of 803 SNPs discovered to be associated with T2Dusing a typical meta-analysis, we discovered 219 SNPs with replicatedassociations with T2D. We recommend complementing a meta-analysis with areplicability analysis for GWA studies."," 10.1214/13-AOAS697"," 2014"

A Euribor-OIS Spread Perspective"," INTERNATIONAL FINANCE"," Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the level andvolatility of the Euribor-OIS spreads have increased significantly.According to the literature, this variability is mainly explained bycredit and liquidity risk premia. I provide evidence that part of thevariability might also be explained by ambiguity in the phrasing of theEuribor survey. The participants in the survey are asked at what ratethey believe interbank funds are exchanged between prime banks; giventhe lack of a clear definition of a prime bank, this question mightleave room for subjective judgment. In particular, I find evidence thatsome of the variability of the Euribor rates might be explained bychanges in the survey participants' perception of what a prime bank is.This evidence adds to the difficulties already encountered by previousstudies in identifying and measuring exactly the determinants of theEuribor rates.

" J"," Balka, KerstinRaasch, ChristinaHerstatt, Cornelius"," The Effect of Selective Openness on Value Creation in User InnovationCommunities"," JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT"," Open innovation research and practice recognize the important role ofexternal complementors in value creation. At the same time, firms needto retain exclusive control over some essential components to capturevalue from their product and/or service system. This paper contributesto the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between opennessto external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. Itfocuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how itaffects value creation by external complementors, specifically themembers of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized,matters to community members: The more open a product design is, thehigher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and thelarger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, differentforms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically thetransparency, accessibility, and replicability of different componentsof the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on surveydata (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics andinformation technology hardware industries. Multilevel regressionanalysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependentdata, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increasescommunity members' involvement in the innovation project and theircontributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci ofopenness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, whileothers have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at leastin relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face betweenexternal value creation and internal value capture is softer thanhitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explainthese patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to valuethe form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives toexploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selectiveopenness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand fordifferent forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-sidestrategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of thedemand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective opennessand to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems."," 10.1111/jpim.12102"," 2014"

There is considerable experience,however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horsesand dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baselinekinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,weaned piglets.Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to trot over apressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10 weeks,starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recorded forall four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), verticalimpulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runsper measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based onthe average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was usedto determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated toassess within-session replicability.Results: Intra-class correlations showed good within-sessionreplicability. Body-weight normalized PVF (nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) andPVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. A highervelocity was associated with a higher nPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parametersvaried between weeks. ASI of LR and VI were higher in the forelimbs thanin the hind limbs. Velocity and time did not influence ASI of any of thevariables.Conclusions: Kinetic pressure mat measurements from healthy weanedpiglets are highly replicable within-session. However, these variablespresent a significant variability between-session, which may be due toconformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearlyinfluences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have highervalues in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do notaffect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot becontrolled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective wayto analyze and quantify porcine gait."," 10.1186/1746-6148-10-37"," 2014"

To address these inconsistencies, weexamined the moderational and mediational role of attention bias in theefficacy of attention training. We compared data reported by Carlbringet al.

We also comparedall attention training groups to an internet-deliveredcognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) condition (n = 40). Participants inthe AMP + FACT group experienced greater reductions in social anxietysymptoms than both active (n = 40) and control (n = 39) groups reportedby Carlbring et al., and did not differ in symptom reductions from theiCBT group. Higher attention bias predicted greater symptom reductionsfor participants who completed AMP, but not for the control group.Moreover, change in attention bias mediated the relationship between AMPgroup (active condition reported by Carlbring et al. versus AMP + FACT)and change in social anxiety symptoms.

In this study, viral infection potential, replication kinetics,and pathogenicity were compared. The solid-phase binding assaydemonstrated that both viruses prominently maintained a preference forthe human-type receptor and the reassortant A/swine/Jilin/37/2008(Sw/JL/37/08) showed relatively higher binding affinities than thenon-reassortant A/swine/Jilin/19/2007 (Sw/JL/19/07). Replicationkinetics showed that Sw/JL/37/08 had higher replicability in MDCK cellsthan Sw/JL/19/07. The mouse experiments clearly revealed thatSw/JL/37/08 had higher virulence than Sw/JL/19/07 as measured by moresignificant body weight loss, higher viral lung load, delayed viralclearance from lungs, and more severe pulmonary lesions. Sequenceanalysis indicated that the absence of glycosylation sites at residue126 of HA and 93 of NA, as well as the characteristic NS1 C-terminal PLresidues of ESEV may account for the increased replication andpathogenicity of Sw/JL/37/08.

In premodern period, as literaryworks were in most cases composed in a literary style with poeticrhymes, it was nearly impossible that they gained popularity among theordinary people. Furthermore, as intellectuals attached greaterimportance to the study of Yi(義) and Li(理), and the realization of theConfucian ideology, the literary works that pursued rhetoricalembellishments and the preparation for state examination were consideredlow and degrading. Thus, the works that depicted the life of the commonpeople in detail or expressed one’s personal sentiment could only beestimated properly when they were related to the study of Yi and Li. Butin late Joseon period, as the intellectual class began to be dividedinto several groups, poor scholars who shared daily life with ordinarypeople endeavored to write without hierarchical and political notion.They were neither scholars with official post who were in charge ofnational documents, nor tasteful writers who belonged to literarysocieties.

Neither short-termhumanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adaptedfor such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form,can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work bestwhen national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aidmodalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 andtheir results and implications. Literature review and case experiencewas utilised. Discussion: By focusing on working with line ministries innon-contested sectors to determine local priorities rather thanfollowing global prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale ratherthan delivering through fragmented projects, and building on nationalsystems and capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, theTransition Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners inpartnership with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve importantresults in health, education, social support and water services in achallenging setting. In addition, forums for collaboration weredeveloped that provided a platform for further action. The initialemphasis on service delivery diffused much of the political delicatenessthat impeded progress in other sectors.

In this paper we define ageneral method to identify points of dynamicity in simulationexperiments and to handle them in order to enable replicability. Wesystematically examine different types of service binding strategies,the main source of dynamicity, and derive a method and correspondingarchitecture to handle this dynamicity with respect to replicability.Our work enables scientists to perform simulation experiments thatexploit the dynamicity and flexibility of SOC and Cloud Computing butstill are repeatable."," 10.1109/SOCA.2014.54"," 2014"

Methods A knownconcentration of methylene blue was collected in standards after thecolorimetric solid-phase extraction. An aqueous solution containing aknown concentration of methylene blue was collected by the solid-phasecolorimetric extraction method. A known concentration of methylene bluewith 1% acetic acid and methanol solution was collected by directcolorimetric method. Three sets of numerical data were compared toinvestigate the effects of methylene blue in the operation of thesolid-phase extraction. Results Using the colorimetric method, 1 to 5mumoL/L of 1% methylene blue acetate methanol solution was directlycompared by the differences in color. Then , a solution containing 1 to5 mumoL/L methylene blue solution, a solution containing 1 to 5 mumoL/Lmethylene blue plasma obtained through the Waters Oasis HLB columnsolid-phase extraction, and a methanol solution containing 1 % aceticacid were compared with a colorimetric spectrophotometer. The resultswere compared to methylene blue at 92. 9% of the extraction rate. Thelinearity was satis-factory. Conclusion Using the solid-phase extractionspectrophotometer method to detect methylene blue, the methylenebluecontent had a favorable recovery rate and replicability. Hence,theCentral Asian's routine quality control method is effective and feasibleto detect the methylene blue content in virus-inactivated plasma. Thedissolution of methylene blue in plasma after extraction or in distilledwater/1 % acetic acid and methanol resulted in the same concentration ofmethylene blue. The values of methylene blue were close to the matchingT-test value of 0.010 2,with P <0. 05,indicating that there was nostatistically significant difference between the two values. The resultssuggest that when plasma is in shortage, distilled water or 1% aceticacid in methanol can substitute for blood plasma to detect the releaseof methylene blue contents.",NA," 2014"

Thecandidate predictor variables were child's gender, home or healthfacility place of birth, vaginal or caesarean mode of birth, urban orrural setting, province of residence, Wealth Index and maternaleducation, occupation, literacy and media exposure.Setting: Kenya.Participants: 6375 dyads of mothers aged 15-49 and their children aged0-23 months (2125 dyads in each of the survey years).Results: Mode of birth and province were statistically significantpredictors of EarlyBF in 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009.

" J"," Jenkins, David G."," Lakes and rivers as microcosms, version 2.0"," JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY"," Limnology has been greatly influenced by The lake as a Microcosm(Forbes, 1887), which described a holistic focus on the internalmachinations of singular, island-like aquatic ecosystems. I considerthree persistent influences of The lake as a Microcosm: as an organizingparadigm for the teaching of limnology relative to its practice; theidea that inland waters are like islands, and the replicability of typesof inland waters. Based on inspection of recent peer-reviewed literatureand 32 limnology texts, we teach limnology according to Forbes but donot practice it in that holistic context. Instead, we practice limnologyas aquatic ecology. Based on novel analyses of species-arearelationships for 275 inland waters and 392 islands, inland waters aremore like continental habitat patches than islands; the island metaphoris poetic but not accurate. Based on a quantitative review of betadiversity (40 data sets representing 10,576 inland waters and 26 datasets representing 1529 terrestrial sites), aquatic systems are no morereplicable than are terrestrial systems; a typological approach tolimnology is no more justified than it is in terrestrial systems.I conclude that a former distinction between limnology and aquaticecology no longer applies, and that we should define limnology as theecology of inland waters. Also, we should not consider lakes and riversas islands that represent other systems of the same type, but shouldconsider them as open, interactive habitat patches that vary accordingto their geology and biogeography. I suggest modern limnology operatesaccording to 3 paradigms, which combine to form 3 broad limnologicaldisciplines and establish a basis for a plural, interactive view oflakes and rivers as microcosms. This model of modern limnology may helpbetter connect it to ecology and biogeography and help limnology be evenmore relevant to science and society"," 10.4081/jlimnol.2014.797"," 2014"

In thatthesis, I examined the non-delegation doctrine based on due-processprinciple. To achieve it, I considered it from three points of view:substantial due-process under which a delegation is not proper unlessthe legislature impose substantial restriction on agencies discretionenough to guarantee that such discretion is not limitless; structuraldue-process under which the person incurring damages from the act ofagencies will be given an opportunity to have courts' judicial review onconstitutionality of such delegation; and procedural due-process underwhich governmental agencies exercise their legislative rights bysupplementing legitimacy through deliberation and participation. Underthe structural due-process, in this paper, I put the judicial branch,monitoring legitimacy of delegation, and the executive branch,requesting for judicial deference to their interpretation, in equalposition. And then, based on the assumption that the structure of theConstitution itself where a judicial review is to be expected justifieslegislative delegation, I explore who is the best institution tointerpret, that is to say, what competence is required, or who has thecompetence like that. For this, I introduce the Institutional Terntheory under which dogmatism and formalism of jurisprudence arecriticized and the law must become reflexive and bottom-up. In spite oftheir differences, most of supporters of the theory assert that thejudicial branch should defer to the interpretation of the executivebecause of its competence as responsibility and expertise. Depending onthe type of public interest the social community desires to have, thelegacy of legislation and its implementation would be the form of eitherindustrial regulation and environment-friendly or industrialderegulation and environmental development. In terms of this, in thispaper, I state my view that the role of courts is to strike balance ofthem and the values of legal system of the followings should beconsidered as standards to be applied by the courts at the moment:predictability; replicability; systemic consistency; responsiveness;justice; fairness; doctrinal stability; social congruence; social valueformation, and so on. In doing so, we can recognize that theconsideration of institutional competence and value of legal system isposted in the course of balancing between the judicial branch andexecutive branch as per changes in social and environmental context,since they go along with the history of justification model ofadministrative state.",NA," 2014"

TheStandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture(STRICTA) is a reporting guideline for key elements of acupunctureinterventions in clinical trials. This study used STRICTA to investigatewhether Cochrane reviews of acupuncture adequately report importanttreatment details.Design: Systematic review Methods: Cochrane reviews of acupuncture wereidentified from The Cochrane Library (issue 7, 2012). Randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs) included in the reviews and published after2005 were obtained. Using STRICTA, we extracted acupuncture-relatedinformation from the Cochrane reviews and the RCTs. The characteristicsof the included studies' table were the major source of interventioninformation from Cochrane reviews. Reporting quality of acupunctureinterventions in Cochrane reviews was assessed and compared with therespective RCTs.Results: 25 Cochrane reviews of acupuncture and 92 RCTs met theselection criteria. Cochrane reviews were 16% less likely to report theacupuncture-related items of STRICTA than RCTs (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI0.79 to 0.88, I-2=8%). Information was significantly better reported for10 of the 15 treatment-group items of STRICTA in RCTs than in Cochranereviews (p<0.05), while four items did so without statisticalsignificance.

While these devices are traditionallyfabricated using lithography and etching, their performance is oftenlimited by defects and sidewall roughness arising from fabricationimperfections. This paper reports a versatile, roll-to-roll and backendcompatible technique for the fabrication of high-performance,high-index-contrast photonic structures in composition-engineeredchalcogenide glass (ChG) thin films. Thin film ChG have emerged asimportant materials for photonic applications due to their highrefractive index, excellent transparency in the infrared and large Kerrnon-linearity. Both thermally evaporated and solution processed As-Sethin films are successfully employed to imprint waveguides andmicro-ring resonators with high replicability and low surface roughness(0.9 nm). The micro-ring resonators exhibit an ultra-high quality-factorof 4 times 10 5 near 1550 nm wavelength, which represents the highestvalue reported in ChG micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, sub-micronnanoimprint of ChG films on non-planar plastic substrates isdemonstrated, which establishes the method as a facile route formonolithic fabrication of high-index-contrast devices on a wide array ofunconventional substrates.

In the past 40 years, temperature in Siziwang Banner wasslowly increasing. The precipitation and storms were fluctuatinggreatly, but the long-term trend did not change much though mostherdsmen reported that the rainfall was significantly decreasing. Recentyears of extreme climate events impressed herdsmen most. As to theimpacts of extreme climate events, drought was most impressive toherders followed by snowstorms and sandstorms. For adapting to climatechange herdsmen had spontaneously taken various adaptive measures, ofwhich 22 adaptation measures were reported in the survey. The top fivemeasures that were used by most herdsmen are storing more hay andforage, reducing the herd size, building warm shed, borrowing money(loan), and not let next generations be herders. Others include buildingcorral, digging well, planting fodder, cooperation in vaccinations ofcattle, reducing household expenditures, changing grazing location,renting grassland, introducing new breeds, savings, wage labor, givingup herding, alternative livelihoods (e.g. tourism), sharing herdingarrangement, etc. The 22 spontaneous adaptation measures were assessedby experts with the method of multiple criteria analysis (MCA). Thecriteria include effectiveness, economic benefits, flexibility,no-regret, side-effect, compliance with government policies and plans,compatibility with development goals, and replicability. The resultsshowed that building warm shed, the introduction of new breeds, hay andforage storage, reducing the herd size and wage labor met the mostcriteria. The spontaneous adaptation measures were further screened byherdsmen, researchers, and local government officials with theparticipatory method. The results showed that measures such as buildingwarm shed, introduction of new breeds, hay and forage storage, reducingthe herd size and loan were more effective than others, which did nottotally coincide with the results of expert assessment.

There is considerable experience,however, with objective gait analysis in other species, such as horsesand dogs. In this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baselinekinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing,weaned piglets. Ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained totrot over a pressure mat. Measurements were performed weekly during 10weeks, starting at 5 weeks of age. Four kinetic parameters were recordedfor all four limbs: peak vertical force (PVF), load rate (LR), verticalimpulse (VI) and peak vertical pressure (PVP). Three representative runsper measuring session per pig were collected. For each of the variables,left vs. right limb asymmetry-indices (ASI's) were calculated based onthe average for that parameter per week. A linear mixed model was usedto determine the influence of time (week), velocity, and limb (left vs.right, and fore vs. hind). Intra-class correlations were calculated toassess within-session replicability. Results: Intra-class correlationsshowed good within-session replicability. Body-weight normalized PVF(nPVF), LR (nLR), VI (nVI) and PVP (nPVP) were higher in the forelimbsthan in the hind limbs. A higher velocity was associated with a highernPVF, nLR and nPVP. All parameters varied between weeks. ASI of LR andVI were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs. Velocity andtime did not influence ASI of any of the variables. Conclusions: Kineticpressure mat measurements from healthy weaned piglets are highlyreplicable within-session. However, these variables present asignificant variability between-session, which may be due toconformational changes of the young, growing piglets. Velocity clearlyinfluences nPVF, nLR and nPVP, and all kinetic variables have highervalues in forelimbs than in hind limbs. As time and velocity do notaffect ASI's, the latter are preferable tools when velocity cannot becontrolled or when measurements are repeated over longer time intervals.The present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective wayto analyze and quantify porcine gait.",NA," 2014"
" J"," Cesario, Joseph"," Priming, Replication, and the Hardest Science"," PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE"," Concerns have been raised recently about the replicability of behavioralpriming effects, and calls have been issued to identify primingmethodologies with effects that can be obtained in any context and withany population. I argue that such expectations are misguided andinconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as acomputational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to behighly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subjectpopulations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous orcapricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absenttheories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to suchvariation, failures to replicate another researcher's findings willnecessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can bemade. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theoriesexist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time.Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide directreplications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient inmeeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state ofconfusion. The recommendations issued in this article reflect concernsboth with the practice of priming researchers and with the inappropriateexpectations of researchers who have failed to replicate others' primingeffects."," 10.1177/1745691613513470"," 2014"

Psychologists are encouraged toconduct more exact replications of published studies to assess thereproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that thealleged crisis of replicability is primarily due to an epistemologicalmisunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of itsunderlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may notserve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identicaloperationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different timesand with different subject populations might test different theoreticalconstructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications,attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient.Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized thatreflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in theoriginal study."," 10.1177/1745691613514450"," 2014"

Specific andcomplementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a commonfunctional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene(5-HTTLPR) moderated the effect of childhood maltreatment on chronicdepression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the effectsof adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes;in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derivedneurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) moderated the effect of stressful lifeevents in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did notinfluence the effects of childhood maltreatment. Molecular mechanismsunderlying gene-environment interactions are being uncovered, includingDNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications.

An acknowledgedbenefit of using SPs is the opportunity to provide a standardized methodby which students can demonstrate and develop their competency.Relatively little is known, however, about the capacity of SPs to offeran accurate and standardized performance across a speech-languagetherapy student cohort.AimsTo investigate the accuracy, reproducibility (consistent performanceof each SP across student interviews) and replicability (consistentperformance of a number of SPs across each scenario) of SPs portrayingthree scenarios, each as a parent of a child presenting with a speechdisorder.Methods & ProceduresForty-four speech-language therapy studentsinterviewed four SPs to gain a case history. All interviews werevideotaped. The accuracy of SP portrayal of key features of eachscenario was scored by an expert rater and two other raters. Data wereanalysed to determine levels of accuracy, reproducibility andreplicability, and inter-rater reliability was evaluated.Outcomes & ResultsSPs were found to have moderate to high levels ofaccuracy across the three scenarios. There were no significantdifferences in the performances of each individual SP across interviewsor between all SPs on each scenario, indicating that reproducibility andreplicability were achieved. Overall inter-rater reliability betweenraters across all scenarios was greater than 80%.Conclusions & ImplicationsThe results would seem to indicate that SPscan present in a standardized manner within a speech-language therapycontext, confirming the value of their inclusion in clinical educationprogrammes.

In non-humanprimate models replicating adenovirus (Ad)-HIV/SIV recombinant vaccinevectors have been shown to stimulate potent immune responses culminatingin protection against challenge exposures. Nonetheless, an increase inthe transgene carrying capacity of these Ad vectors, currently limitedto approximately 3000 base pairs, would greatly enhance their utility.Using a replicating, E3-deleted Ad type 5 host range mutant (Ad5 hr)encoding full-length single-chain HIV(BaL)gp120 linked to the D1 and D2domains of rhesus macaque CD4 (rhFLSC) we systematically deleted thegenes encoding early region 4 open reading frame 1 (E4orf1) throughE4orf4. All the Ad-rhFLSC vectors produced similar levels of viralprogeny. Cell cycle analysis of infected human and monkey cells revealedno differences in virus-host interaction. The parental and E4-deletedviruses expressed comparable levels of the transgene with kineticssimilar to Ad late proteins. Similar levels of cellular immune responsesand transgene-specific antibodies were elicited in vaccinated mice.However, differences in recognition of Ad proteins and induced antibodysubtypes were observed, suggesting that the E4 gene products mightmodulate antibody responses by as yet unknown mechanisms. In short, wehave improved the transgene carrying capacity by one thousand base pairswhile preserving the replicability, levels of transgene expression, andimmunogenicity critical to these vaccine vectors. This additional spaceallows for flexibility in vaccine design that could not be obtained withthe current vector and as such should facilitate the goal of improvingvaccine efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reportdescribing the effects of these E4 deletions on transgene expression andimmunogenicity in a replicating Ad vector."," 10.1371/journal.pone.0076344"," 2013"

There is an unacceptable delay in the diagnosis of axialspondyloarthritis (axSpA) in its early stages among patients at highrisk, in particular those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ourobjectives were to develop a sensible and reliable questionnaire toidentify undetected axSpA among patients with IBD.Methods. Literature was reviewed for item generation in the TorontoaxSpA Questionnaire on IBD (TASQ-IBD). Sensibility of the questionnairewas assessed among healthcare professionals and patients. Thisassessment was related to purpose and framework (clinical function,clinical justification, and clinical applicability), face validity,comprehensiveness [oligo-variability (limiting the questionnaire toimportant items) and transparency], replicability, content validity, andfeasibility. The test-retest reliability study was administered to 77patients with established IBD and axSpA. Kappa agreement coefficientsand absolute agreement were calculated for items.Results. Three domains included IBD, inflammatory back symptoms, andextraaxial features. The entry criterion required a patient to have IBDand back pain or stiffness that ever persisted for >= 3 months.Iterative sensibility assessment involved 16 items and a diagram of theback. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.81-1.00 for each item. Absoluteagreement across all items ranged from 91% to 100%.Conclusion. TASQ-IBD is a newly developed, sensible, and reliablecase-finding questionnaire to be administered to patients with IBD whohave ever had chronic back pain or stiffness persisting for >= 3 months.It should facilitate identification and timely referral of patients withIBD to rheumatologists and minimize the delay in diagnosis of axSpA.Consequently, it should assess the prevalence of axSpA in IBD."," 10.3899/jrheum.130048"," 2013"

Appraisal status targets may be sustainability,compliance with a standard (such as the UN code of conduct forresponsible fisheries) or the degree of progress in meeting some othergoal or target. The method combines semi-quantitative (e.g. ecological)and qualitative (e.g. social) data via multiple evaluation fields, eachof which is assessed through scores assigned to six to 12 attributes orindicators: the scoring method allows user flexibility to adopt a widerange of utility relationships. For assessing sustainability, sixevaluation fields have been developed: ecological, technological,economic, social, ethical and institutional. Each field can be assesseddirectly with a set of scored attributes, or several of the fields canbe dealt with in greater detail using nested subfields that themselvescomprise multidimensional Rapfish assessments (e.g. the hierarchicalinstitutional field encompasses both governance and management,including a detailed analysis of legality). The user has the choice ofincluding all or only some of the available sustainability fields. Forthe attributes themselves, there will rarely be quantitative data, butscoring allows these items to be estimated. Indeed, within a normativeframework, one important advantage with Rapfish is transparency of therigour, quality and replicability of the scores. The Rapfish techniqueemploys a constrained multidimensional ordination that is scaled tosituate data points within evaluation space. Within each evaluationfield, results may be presented as a two-dimensional plot or in aone-dimensional rank order. Uncertainty is expressed through theprobability distribution of Monte-Carlo simulations that use the c.l. oneach original observation. Overall results of the multidisciplinaryanalysis may be shown using kite diagrams that compare differentlocations, time periods (including future projections) and managementscenarios, which make policy trade-offs explicit. These enhancements arenow available in the R programming language and on an open website,where users can run Rapfish analyses by downloading the software oruploading their data to a user interface.

A total of 579 sets of dental casts, representing sixethnic groups, were scored using the five-grade system proposed byBurnett et al. (2010). The frequency and distribution of the MxPAR weredetermined by tooth type, sex, side, locus and ethnicity, and theapplicability of the scoring system was assessed. The MxPAR was found inapproximately two-thirds of premolar teeth, more often on second thanfirst premolars, and more often on the distal aspect of the occlusalsurface than the mesial. There was some evidence that more pronouncedforms of the feature occurred more often in males than females, and thatthere may be some directionality in its expression between sides.Variation was also noted in the frequency of occurrence and degree ofexpression of the MxPAR between ethnic groups. Intra- and inter-observerconcordance rates for scoring the MxPAR were low, confirming that it wasdifficult to score the trait identically on two different occasions.

The defaultmode network (DMN) is one of the most frequently studied resting-statenetworks. However, less is known about specific structural dependency orinteractions among brain regions within the DMN in AD. In this study, weperformed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis based on regional grey mattervolumes to identify differences in structural interactions among coreDMN regions in structural MRI data from 80 AD patients and 101 normalcontrols (NC). Compared to NC, the structural interactions between themedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and other brain regions, including theleft inferior parietal cortex (IPC), the left inferior temporal cortex(ITC) and the right hippocampus (HP), were significantly reduced in theAD group. In addition, the AD group showed prominent increases instructural interactions from the left ITC to the left HP, the left HP tothe right ITC, the right HP to the right ITC, and the right IPC to theposterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The BN models significantlydistinguished AD patients from NC with 87.12% specificity and 81.25%sensitivity. We then used the derived BN models to examine thereplicability and stability of AD-associated BN models in an independentdataset and the results indicated discriminability with 83.64%specificity and 80.49% sensitivity.

We propose acommunity-based palliative care (CPC) model that spans the array ofinpatient and outpatient settings in which palliative care is providedand links seamlessly to inpatient care; likewise, it would span the fulltrajectory of advanced illness rather than focusing on the period justbefore death. Examples of CPC programs are developing organically acrossthe U.S. As our understanding of CPC expands, standardization is neededto ensure replicability, consistency, and the ability to relateintervention models to outcomes. A growing body of literature examiningoutpatient palliative care supports the role of CPC in improvingoutcomes, including reduction in symptom burden, improved quality oflife, increased survival, better satisfaction with care, and reducedhealth care resource utilization. Furthermore the examination of how tooperationalize CPC is needed before widespread implementation can berealized. This article describes the key characteristics of CPC,highlighting its role in longitudinal care across patient transitions.Distinguishing features include consistent care across the diseasetrajectory independent of diagnosis and prognosis; inclusion ofinpatient, outpatient, long-term care, and at-home care delivery;collaboration with other medical disciplines, nursing, and alliedhealth; and full integration into the health care system (rather thanparallel delivery).

Authenticity is judged by the convergenceof multiple features within individual cells. Our procedure lasts 80days and couples neural induction via BMP/TGF-beta inhibition withexposure to the developmental factors sonic hedgehog (SHH) and dickkopf1(DKK-1) to drive ventral telencephalic specification, followed byterminal differentiation [1]. Authenticity of the resulting neuronalpopulation is monitored by the appearance of FOXG1(+)/GSX2(+) progenitorcells of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) at day 15-25 ofdifferentiation, followed by appearance of CTIP2-, FOXP1- andFOXP2-positive cells at day 45. These precursor cells then mature intoMAP2(+)/GABA(+) neurons with 20 % of them ultimately co-expressing theDARPP-32 and CTIP2 diagnostic markers and carrying electrophysiologicalproperties expected for fully functional MSNs.The protocol is characterized by its replicability in at least threehuman pluripotent cell lines. Altogether this protocol defines a usefulplatform for in vitro developmental neurobiology studies, drugscreening, and regenerative medicine approaches."," 10.1007/s12015-013-9441-8"," 2013"

Recently, ICNs have become popular for investigatingbrain functioning and brain-behavior relationships. However, thereplicability and neurometrics of these networks are only beginning tobe reported. Using a meta-level independent component analysis (ICA), weproduced ICNs from three data sets collected from two samples of healthyadults. The ICNs from our data sets demonstrated robust and independentreplication of 12 intrinsic networks that reflected 17 canonical,task-based, brain networks. We found within-subject reliability of ICNswas modest overall, but ranged from poor to good, and that voxels withthe highest measured connectivity rarely had the highest reliability.Networks associated with executive functions, visuospatial reasoning,motor coordination, speech and audition, default mode, vision, andinteroception showed moderate to high group-level reproducibility andreplicability. However, only the first four of these networks alsoshowed fair or better within-subject reliability over time. Our findingshighlight the replicability of ICNs across data sets, the range ofwithin-subject neurometrics across different networks, and the sharedcharacteristics between resting and task-based networks.

Here, wereview the literature in which seasonal or circannual rhythms wereexamined under typical 12:12 h photoperiods and present our historicaldata of locomotor activity of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats acrossseveral seasons and years.

Results of the few anxiety behavior assessments werefairly consistent, at least in rat studies. Two studies of pain-relatedbehaviors indicated decreased responses during spring or summer testing.If such seasonal effects are real, this would imply that laboratoryrodents have a type of internal Type 2 circannual clock or endogenousoscillator.

Taking a socioecological perspectiveto psychology, which emphasizes the role of social habitats and theirinteractions with mind and behavior, we investigated regional variationin and correlates of an entrepreneurship-prone Big Five profile.Specifically, we analyzed personality data collected from over half amillion U.S. residents (N = 619,397) as well as public archival data onstate-level entrepreneurial activity (i.e., business-creation andself-employment rates). Results revealed that an entrepreneurship-pronepersonality profile is regionally clustered. This geographicaldistribution corresponds to the pattern that can be observed whenmapping entrepreneurial activity across the United States. Indeed, thestate-level correlation (N = 51) between an entrepreneurial personalitystructure and entrepreneurial activity was positive in direction,substantial in magnitude, and robust even when controlling for regionaleconomic prosperity. These correlations persisted at the level of U.S.metropolitan statistical areas (N = 15) and were replicated inindependent German (N = 19,842; 14 regions) and British (N = 15,617; 12regions) samples.

Unfortunately, the lack of arigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate thisproblem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlesslyintroduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical developmentprocess with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing asimple layer of software structuring.Results: Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelineswith code that can be transparently inserted into the user's Pythoncode. Its syntax is designed to visually highlight dependencies in thepipeline structure it defines. While encouraging the developer to thinkin terms of bioinformatic pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automatedfeatures including data and session persistence, consistency checksbetween steps of the analysis, processing optimization and publicationof the analytic protocol in the form of a hypertext.Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between plan-driven andchange-driven development environments in the design, management andcommunication of bioinformatic pipelines.

Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associatedvariants across populations can help in solving these issues. We presenta comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Mostloci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have beenextensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asianancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry ismuch less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of OddsRatios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlyingcausal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries.Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomicregions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantlybetween populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger samplesizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lowerfrequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due tocommon variants. In addition, the sharing of disease alleles and thehigh correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of theunderlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asiansand that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs."," 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003566"," 2013"

Hypotheses tested were: common extensor origin sizecorrelates with humerus size; ECs change the size and shape of entheses;surface area is increased in those entheses with bony proliferation. Thecommon extensor origins of 43 male skeletons from medieval York wererecorded. The entheses were recorded visually for any deviation from asmooth surface. The chord was measured using sliding calipers and theshape of the entheses recorded using a profile gauge and quantifiedusing parameters (e.g. the standard deviation of the surface from a meanline) which assess the relationship of the surface to a flat surface. Totest replicability, disarticulated humeri were also recorded(inter-observer error n = 9; intra-observer error n = 20) using the samemethodology. Replicability for size and shape was good forintra-observer error but weaker for inter-observer error. There isvariability in enthesis size and distal humeral condyle size; normalentheses are smaller than those with EC while their surface shapediffers and is affected by the type of EC (proliferative ordestructive); surface area in those entheses with proliferative ECs isincreased. The use of these parameters for quantifying enthesis size andshape provides insights into enthesis variability which cannot be testedusing visual methods alone.

With theadvance of modern technology, accuracy of measurements is much improvedby developments in design of terrestrial laser scanners. Currently, thistechnology is used in large and complex engineering structures such asdams. Although TLS is a high cost technology, it is particularly used inmonitoring of dam deformations, due to its speed in obtaining thousandsof data points, ability to visualize the scanned object and itsenvironment with high accuracy and ability to take long-rangemeasurements. In order to determine the effect of change in waterreservoir levels on body of the dam, TLS are used to take deformationmeasurements in different time intervals, where the water level was atmaximum, minimum and medium levels. This paper provides an overview ofterrestrial laser scanning technology for deformation monitoring. Theconcrete arch dam in Antalya Oymapinar, Turkey was used for case study.Four different scannings were performed in this dam in order to verifythe replicability of TLS results on same water levels and equivalentconditions.

However, cyclothymic disorder in children is rarely researched,or often subsumed in an ""NOS"" category. The present study tests thereplicability of findings from an earlier study, and expands on thecriterion validity of cyclothymic disorder in youth. Using the Robinsand Guze (1970) framework we examined the validity of cyclothymicdisorder as a subtype of BP. Using a youth (ages 5-17) outpatientclinical sample (N = 894), participants with cyclothymic disorder (n =53) were compared to participants with other BP spectrum disorders (n =399) and to participants with non-bipolar disorders (n = 442). Analysestested differences in youth with cyclothymic disorder and bipolardisorder not otherwise specified who do, and those who do not, have aparent with BP. Compared to youth with non-bipolar disorders, youth withcyclothymic disorder had higher irritability (p < 0.001), morecomorbidity (p < 0.001), greater sleep disturbance (p < 0.005), and weremore likely to have a family history of BP (p < 0.001). Cyclothymicdisorder was associated with a younger age of onset compared todepression (p < 0.001) and bipolar II (p = 0.05). Parental BP status wasnot significantly associated with any variables. Results support thatcyclothymic disorder belongs on the bipolar spectrum. Epidemiologicalstudies indicate that cyclothymic disorder is not uncommon and involvessignificant impairment. Failing to differentiate between cyclothymicdisorder and bipolar NOS limits our knowledge about a significantproportion of cases of bipolarity."," 10.1007/s10802-012-9680-1"," 2013"

Using new analysis of existing training sets andsediment-cores we examine the statistical and ecological constraints ofdiatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) models. Although the models show anapparently strong relationship between measured and inferred TP in thetraining sets, even under cross-validation, the models display threefundamental weaknesses, namely (1) the relationship between TP anddiatom relative abundance is heavily confounded with secondary variablessuch as alkalinity and lake depth, (2) the models contain many taxa thatare not significantly related to TP, and (3) comparison betweendifferent models shows poor or no spatial replicability. At some sitesthe sediment-core diatom assemblage change tracks the TP gradient in thetraining sets and DI-TP reconstructions are consistent with monitored TPdata and known catchment histories for the recent past. At others diatomspecies turnover is apparently related to variables other than TP, andDI-TP fails to even reproduce plausible trends. Pre-disturbance DI-TPvalues are also questionable atmost sites.

In addition, recent data suggest that patientengagement and motivation are critical ingredients for effectiveself-management. This article carefully describes a self-managementintervention using motivational interviewing skills, aimed to increaseengagement and commitment in severe COPD patients.METHODS: The intervention was developed and pilot tested for fidelity toprotocol, for patient and interventionist feedback (qualitative) andeffect on quality of life. Engagement between patient andinterventionists was measured by the Working Alliance Inventory. Theintervention was refined on the basis of the results of the pilot studyand delivered in the active arm of a prospective randomized study.RESULTS: The pilot study suggested improvements in quality of life,fidelity to theory, and patient acceptability. The refinedself-management intervention was delivered 540 times in the active armof a randomized study. We observed a retention rate of 86% (patientsmissing or not available for only 14% the scheduled encounters).CONCLUSIONS: A self-management intervention that includes motivationalinterviewing as the way if guiding patients into behavior change isfeasible in severe COPD and may increase patient engagement andcommitment to self-management.

Because species-specific brainmechanisms for fast vision must have evolved under heavy pressure forefficiency, it has been held that different human individuals see thephysical world in the same way and produce psychophysical functions ofvisual discrimination that are qualitatively the same. For many years,this assumption has been implicitly accepted in vision research studyingextremely fast, basic visual processes, including studies of visualmasking. However, in recent studies of metacontrast masking surprisinglyrobust individual differences in the qualitative aspects of subjects'performance have been found. As the basic species-specific visualfunctions very likely are based on universal brain mechanisms of vision,these differences probably are the outcome of variability in ontogeneticdevelopment (i.e., formation of idiosyncrasic skills of perception).Such developmental differences can be brought about by variants of genesthat are differentially expressed in the course of CNS development. Theobjective of this study was to assess whether visual discrimination inmetacontrast masking is related to three widely studied geneticpolymorphisms implicated in brain function and used here as independentvariables. The findings suggest no main effects of BDNF Val66Met,NRG1/rs6994992, or 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on metacontrast performance,but several notable interactions of genetic variables with gender, stageof the sequence of experimental trials, perceptual strategies, andtarget/mask shape congruence were found. Thus, basic behavioralfunctions of fast vision may be influenced by common geneticvariability. Also, when left uncontrolled, genetic factors may seriouslyconfound variables in vision research using masking, obscure cleartheoretical interpretation, lead to unexplicable inter-regionaldifferences and create problems of replicability of formerly successfulexperiments."," 10.1371/journal.pone.0055287"," 2013"

This article examines a rare case of conservation-induceddisplacement and resettlement where the livelihood outcomes for thedisplaced people are said to be positive. The relocation of over 400households from the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka in the late1990s has been held up as a case where both conservation goals and localpeople's livelihoods gained from displacement.

Honeyhas been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidencefrom animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey mayaccelerate wound healing.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether honey increases therate of healing in acute wounds (e.g. burns, lacerations) and chronicwounds (e.g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).SEARCH METHODS: For this first update of the review we searched theCochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); TheCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochraneLibrary 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); OvidMEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); OvidEMBASE (2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials thatevaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic woundwere sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date ofpublication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from eligible trials were extractedand summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, andindependently verified by a second review author.MAIN RESULTS: We identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including six new trialsthat were added to this update. In acute wounds, three trials evaluatedthe effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgicalwounds and 12 trials evaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronicwounds, two trials evaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers,and single trials investigated its effect in infected post-operativewounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcersand Fournier's gangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groupsof chronic or acute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk ofbias. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey mightreduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD-4.68 days, 95%CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with earlyexcision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- andfull-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). Inchronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venousleg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used asan adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniatealone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Honey dressings do not increase rates of healingsignificantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant tocompression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thicknessburns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneousLeishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honeymight be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there isconsiderable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability ofthis evidence.

" J"," Jull, Andrew B.Walker, NatalieDeshpande, Sohan"," Honey as a topical treatment for wounds"," COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS"," BackgroundHoney is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived from nectargathered and modified by the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Honey has beenused since ancient times as a remedy in wound care. Evidence from animalstudies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate woundhealing.ObjectivesThe objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate ofhealing in acute wounds (e. g. burns, lacerations) and chronic wounds(e. g. skin ulcers, infected surgical wounds).Search methodsFor this first update of the review we searched the Cochrane WoundsGroup Specialised Register (searched 13 June 2012); The Cochrane CentralRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012,Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to May Week 5 2012); Ovid MEDLINE(In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 12 June 2012); Ovid EMBASE(2008 to 2012 Week 23); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 8 June 2012).Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as atreatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There wasno restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.Wound healing was the primary endpoint.Data collection and analysisData from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one reviewauthor, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by asecond review author.Main resultsWe identified 25 trials (with a total of 2987 participants) that met theinclusion criteria, including six new trials that were added to thisupdate. In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey inacute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and 12 trialsevaluated the effect of honey in burns. In chronic wounds, two trialsevaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers, and single trialsinvestigated its effect in infected post-operative wounds, pressureinjuries, cutaneous Lieshmaniasis, diabetic foot ulcers and Fournier'sgangrene. Three trials recruited people into mixed groups of chronic oracute wounds. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias.In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey mightreduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (WMD-4.68 days, 95% CI -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with earlyexcision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- andfull-thickness burns (WMD 13.6 days, 95% CI 10.02 to 17.18 days). Inchronic wounds, honey does not significantly increase healing in venousleg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96to 1.38), and may delay healing in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used asan adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate compared to meglumine antimoniatealone (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01).Authors' conclusionsHoney dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venousleg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delayhealing in partial-and full-thickness burns in comparison to earlyexcision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as anadjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to someconventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertaintyabout the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There isinsufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types ofwounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings forroutine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available."," 10.1002/14651858.CD005083.pub3"," 2013"

Methods: To support a new educational structureprioritizing QI education as a stand-alone priority, a 6-montheducational course was introduced for operational leaders (requiringcompletion of a real-life improvement project) and a second,introductory QI education set of 5 stand-alone classes was introducedfor managers and frontline staff; the latter is provided at centralizedsites, on-site, and via webinars. Additional QI courses have beenintroduced for board members. Results: Sixty operational leadersattended the first 2 offerings of the 6-month course and completed 50associated QI projects, as of July 2012; nearly 1500 participants haveattended the ""Just-in-Time"" classes, representing 13 University ofPittsburgh Medical Center hospitals and affiliated facilities.Eighty-three percent of recent participants rated the 6-month course a 4or 5 in terms of efficacy. Two-thirds of participants from both 6-monthseries reported that they continued to work on their project once theclass was over. Discussion: The number of course attendees and theirfeedback regarding efficacy of this educational approach, as well as thevolume of associated completed projects, indicate success in providinggreater numbers of staff at all levels of the organization with QIeducation and tools. This educational format shows promise for furtherrefinement and replicability."," 10.1097/QMH.0b013e31827deaaa"," 2013"

" J"," Pashler, HaroldHarris, Christine R."," Is the Replicability Crisis Overblown? Three Arguments Examined"," PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE"," We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the currentoutpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first ideais that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonablebounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature,making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minorissue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: Thealpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise inthe literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereasdirect replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replicationattempts are common-providing an even better test of the validity of aphenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than directreplication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias,opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality ofphenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argumentthat errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the fieldwould just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are noplausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what isneeded is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientificpractice."," 10.1177/1745691612463401"," 2012"

We argue that the field oftenconstructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of nullresults and that null results may be further extinguished throughquestionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent onthe process of falsification, we argue that these problems reducepsychological science's capability to have a proper mechanism for theoryfalsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous ""undead""theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact."," 10.1177/1745691612459059"," 2012"

This issue has been related to prominent casesof data fabrication and survey results pointing to bad practices inempirical science.

Instead, we argue that,given the current state of affairs in behavioral science, falsenegatives often constitute a more serious problem. Referring to Wason's(1960) seminal work on inductive reasoning, we show that the failure toassertively generate and test alternative hypotheses can lead todramatic theoretical mistakes, which cannot be corrected by any kind ofrigor applied to statistical tests of the focal hypotheses. We concludethat a scientific culture rewarding strong inference (Platt, 1964) ismore likely to see progress than a culture preoccupied with tighteningits standards for the mere publication of original findings."," 10.1177/1745691612462587"," 2012"

Herpes keratitis is currentlythe leading cause of both cornea-derived and infection-associatedblindness in the developed world. Typical presentation of herpeskeratitis includes infection of the corneal epithelium and sometimes thedeeper corneal stroma and endothelium, leading to such permanent cornealpathologies as scarring, thinning, and opacity (1).Corneal HSV-1 infection is traditionally studied in two types ofexperimental models. The in vitro model, in which cultured monolayers ofcorneal epithelial cells are infected in a Petri dish, offerssimplicity, high level of replicability, fast experiments, andrelatively low costs. On the other hand, the in vivo model, in whichanimals such as rabbits or mice are inoculated directly in the cornea,offers a highly sophisticated physiological system, but has highercosts, longer experiments, necessary animal care, and a greater degreeof variability.In this video article, we provide a detailed demonstration of a new exvivo model of corneal epithelial HSV-1 infection, which combines thestrengths of both the in vitro and the in vivo models. The ex vivo modelutilizes intact corneas organotypically maintained in culture andinfected with HSV-1. The use of the ex vivo model allows for highlyphysiologically-based conclusions, yet it is rather inexpensive andrequires time commitment comparable to that of the in vitro model."," 10.3791/3631"," 2012"

However the method is knownto be highly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers.K-means++ has been proposed to overcome this problem and has been shownto have better accuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. Inmany clustering problems though - such as when classifying georeferenceddata for mapping applications - standardization of clusteringmethodology, specifically, the ability to arrive at the same clusterassignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability of themethodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measureof accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, asin the case of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seedselection algorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute thatdraws initial cluster boundaries along the ""deepest valleys"" or greatestgaps in dataset. Thus, it incorporates a measure to maximize distancebetween consecutive cluster centers which augments the conventionalk-means optimization for minimum distance between cluster center andcluster members. Unlike existing initialization methods, no additionalparameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the clusteringalgorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by asmuch as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the varianceover different runs to zero, without introducing any additionalparameters to the clustering process. Further, the proposed method ismore computationally efficient than k-means++ and in some cases, moreaccurate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."," 10.1016/j.asoc.2012.07.021"," 2012"

In thispaper, I consider the implications of homoplasy for the debate over thenature of macroevolution. I argue that once the concepts of contingencyand convergence are fleshed out, it becomes clear that many instances ofhomoplasy fail to negate Gould's overarching thesis, and may in factsupport a Gouldian view of life. My argument rests on the distinctionbetween parallelism and convergence, which I defend against a recentchallenge from developmental biology.

A second analysis was designed to test the replicability of thegenetic findings in an independent sample of 109 women and 111 men witha similar history of substance dependence. Results: The results of thefirst analysis showed that BMI was positively correlated with Total andNonplanning Scale Scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and thenumber of childhood symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorderin women. It was also positively correlated, in women, with a GABRA2variant previously implicated as a risk factor for substance dependenceand an objective electroencephalographic feature previously associatedwith GABRA2 and relapse risk.

Overall,the replicability of both the inclusion criteria (mean [standarddeviation (SD)]: 6.0 (2.1), range (min-max): 1-9.5) and exclusioncriteria(mean(SD): 5.3 (2.1), range: 1-9.5) was only moderate. Trialsexcluded patients with many common comorbidities. The proportion ofexclusions for comorbidities ranged from 042 percent for heart failure,0-55 percent for COPD, 0-44 percent for diabetes, and 0-39 percent forstroke. Seventy of the 161 trials (43.5%) described the prevalence ofany comorbidity among participants with the index disease. The reportingof comorbidities in trials was very limited, in terms of reporting anoperational definition and method of ascertainment for the presence ofcomorbidity and treatments for the comorbidity. It was even less commonthat the trials assessed whether comorbidities were potential modifiersof treatment effects.Conclusions: Comorbidities receive little attention in chronic diseasetrials. Given the public health importance of people with multiplechronic conditions, trials should better report on comorbidities andassess the effect comorbidities have on treatment outcomes."," 10.1371/journal.pone.0041601"," 2012"

" J"," Soneji, SamirKing, Gary"," Statistical Security for Social Security"," DEMOGRAPHY"," The financial viability of Social Security, the single largest U.S.government program, depends on accurate forecasts of the solvency of itsintergenerational trust fund. We begin by detailing informationnecessary for replicating the Social Security Administration's (SSA's)forecasting procedures, which until now has been unavailable in thepublic domain. We then offer a way to improve the quality of theseprocedures via age- and sex-specific mortality forecasts. The mostrecent SSA mortality forecasts were based on the best availabletechnology at the time, which was a combination of linear extrapolationand qualitative judgments. Unfortunately, linear extrapolation excludesknown risk factors and is inconsistent with long-standing demographicpatterns, such as the smoothness of age profiles. Modern statisticalmethods typically outperform even the best qualitative judgments inthese contexts. We show how to use such methods, enabling researchers toforecast using far more information, such as the known risk factors ofsmoking and obesity and known demographic patterns. Including this extrainformation makes a substantial difference. For example, by improvingonly mortality forecasting methods, we predict three fewer years of netsurplus, $730 billion less in Social Security Trust Funds, and programcosts that are 0.66% greater for projected taxable payroll by 2031compared with SSA projections. More important than specific numericalestimates are the advantages of transparency, replicability, reductionof uncertainty, and what may be the resulting lower vulnerability to thepoliticization of program forecasts. In addition, by offering with thisarticle software and detailed replication information, we hope tomarshal the efforts of the research community to include ever moreinformative inputs and to continue to reduce uncertainties in SocialSecurity forecasts."," 10.1007/s13524-012-0106-z"," 2012"

Inter-operator variability in the localization ofmelanocytic lesion border"," SKIN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY"," Background: The first step in the analysis of a dermatoscopically imagedmelanocytic lesion is segmentation informally, isolating those points inthe image belonging to the lesion from those belonging to thesurrounding non-lesional skin. Although typically studied in the contextof automated analysis, segmentation is a necessary step even for humanoperators who plan to evaluate quantitative features of a lesion (suchas diameter or asymmetry). Methods: In a double blind evaluation of thesegmentation of 77 digital dermatoscopic images, we observed asignificant inter-operator variability. Results: The area of thedisagreement region was on average 15.28% of the area of the lesionitself, and in 10% of the cases it was more than 28%. More experienceddermatologists showed greater agreement among themselves than with lessexperienced dermatologists, and a slight tendency toward tightersegmentations. Conclusion: The evaluation methodology addresses a numberof crucial difficulties encountered in previous studies and may be ofindependent interest. Our results underscore the necessity of takinginto account inter-operator variability in large epidemiologicalstudies, in particular those involving less experienced dermatologists,and of striving toward techniques allowing greater standardization andreplicability in the evaluation of the fundamental visual parameters oflesions."," 10.1111/j.1600-0846.2011.00572.x"," 2012"

The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections amongchildren by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality byhalf. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned byUNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in communityengagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.Methods: This research involved extensive literature review and keyinformant interviews. Community engagement was defined to includeparticipation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activitiesthat involve communities solely as service recipients. A promisingpractice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence ofits effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication ofreplicability, scale up and/or sustainability.Results: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventingmother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extendingcommunity cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-basedorganizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practicesto improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviourchange communication, peer support and participative approaches togenerate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environmentincluded community activism and government leadership for greaterinvolvement of communities.Committed leadership at all levels, facility, community, district andnational, is crucial to success. Genuine community engagement requires arights-based, capacity-building approach and sustained financial andtechnical investment. Participative formative research is a first stepin building community capacity and helps to ensure programme relevance.Building on existing structures, rather than working in parallel tothem, improves programme efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.Monitoring, innovation and information sharing are critical to scale up.Conclusions: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered forending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers andfamilies: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increaseengagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engagecommunities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promotecommunity- driven social and behaviour change communication includinggrassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empowercommunities to address programme barriers, (7) support communityactivism for political commitment, (8) share tools for communityengagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and(10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not toundermine work that communities are already doing, but rather toactively identify and build on such efforts."," 10.7448/IAS.15.4.17390"," 2012"

Theorizing that this relationship could beutilized to produce a short-term toxicity test, we analyzed theexperimental data and identified 36.5 degrees C as the ideal temperaturefor a 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. After the test wasformulated, it was used to screen 15 toxicants. Eight heavy metals, 4pesticides, 2 anions, phenol, and 2 industrial wastewaters werescreened, using the 1-hour toxicity test and the 24-hour standard acutetoxicity test. For the 1-hour toxicity test, vials containing 5 daphnids(<24 h), medium, and toxicant, all at room temperature, were preparedand placed in a water bath set at 36.5 degrees C for 1 hour. After 1hour, the numbers of live (no toxic effect) daphnids and immobilized(toxic effect) daphnids were counted, and the median effectiveconcentrations (EC50) were determined.A comparison of the EC50 values of the 1-hour temperature-based toxicitytest and those of the 24-hour standard acute toxicity test produced acorrelation of 0.9999. When individual toxicants were compared, the24-hour standard acute toxicity test was better at detecting lower testconcentrations than the 1-hour temperature-based toxicity test. Whenboth tests were used to screen industrial wastewater and their resultswere compared, the 1-hour toxicity test showed some promise. However,further testing will need to be done, because only 2 of the 10 samplescollected initially contained significant amounts of toxicants for EC50calculation. Finally, while the 1-hour toxicity test was effective inscreening 15 tested toxicants and has the potential to be useful inscreening industrial wastewater, this conclusion is limited to those 15tested toxicants and 2 industrial wastewaters. Additional experimentswill be needed for other toxicants. The 1-hour toxicity test presentedin this study is the first temperature-based toxicity test developed forD. magna, and it will be an attractive short-term assay for itsconvenience, cost-efficiency, and replicability."," 10.1089/ees.2011.0006"," 2012"

Yet littleexperimental evidence addresses the critical clinical question ofwhether depression treatment improves ARV adherence and clinicaloutcomes in PLWHA with depression. The Strategies to Link Antidepressantand Antiretroviral Management at Duke, UAB, and UNC (SLAM DUNC) Study isa randomized clinical effectiveness trial funded by the NationalInstitute for Mental Health. The objective of SLAM DUNC is to testwhether a depression treatment program integrated into routine HIVclinical care affects ARV adherence. PLWHA with depression (n = 390) arerandomized to enhanced usual care or a depression treatment model calledMeasurement-Based Care (MBC). MBC deploys a clinically supervisedDepression Care Manager (DCM) to provide evidence-based antidepressanttreatment recommendations to a non-psychiatric prescribing provider,guided by systematic and ongoing measures of depressive symptoms andside effects. MBC has limited time requirements and the DCM role can beeffectively filled by a range of personnel given appropriate trainingand supervision, enhancing replicability. In SLAM DUNC, MBC isintegrated. into HIV care to support HIV providers in antidepressantprescription and management. The primary endpoint is ARV adherencemeasured by unannounced telephone-based pill counts at 6 months withfollow-up to 12 months and secondary endpoints including viral load,health care utilization, and depressive severity. Important outcomes ofthis study will be evidence of the effectiveness of MBC in treatingdepression in PLWHA and improving HIV-related outcomes. (C) 2012Elsevier Inc.

An IR-assisted roll-to-rollembossing facility was designed and built in our laboratory especiallyfor this study. Metallic rollers bearing micropatterns of two differentfeature sizes, namely 150 and 20 mu m in depth, were employed. Theformer one was prepared by microelectric discharge machining the roller,whereas the latter was fabricated by electroplating a thin layer ofnickel on the surface of the roller, followed by a diamond turningprocess to create the microstructures. The embossing facility was usedto replicate the microstructure onto polyethylene terephthalate andpolycarbonate films in the experiments. During roller embossing, the IRradiation shed on the rollers, and the energy was converted into heat tomelt the polymer substrates and to replicate the microstructures. Theinfluence of various processing parameters on the replicability ofmicrofeatures was investigated. Under the proper processing conditions,double-sided flexible polymer substrates with microstructures could besuccessfully fabricated.

Therefore, this study exploratively aims at the identificationof predictors of the use of rehabilitation services in a cohort ofprostate cancer patients.Method: In a prospective multicentre study to evaluate outpatientoncological rehabilitation services, n=242 prostate cancer patients whoused outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation services (""users"") werecompared with n=253 prostate cancer patients who did not userehabilitation (""non-users"") at measure point 1. At the beginning of therehabilitation programme and at the end of primary treatment,respectively, patients completed a self-report questionnaire consistingof standardized instruments designed to assess the following independentvariables: autonomy striving (TPF), self-efficacy expectancy (GSE),distress (distress thermometer), anxiety and depression (HADS-D),quality of life (SF-8), social support (SSUK), rehabilitationmotivation: readiness to change, knowledge, scepticism regardingrehabilitation services (PAREMO-20). Illness- and treatment-relatedvariables (tumour state, comorbidity, primary therapies) were documentedby the attending oncologists.Results: Only few significant and effective differences betweenrehabilitation users and non-users are observed: Non-users are sufferingmore often from gastrointestinal comorbidities (18% vs. 2%, w=0.25).Both patient groups report severe quality-of-life impairments,particularly with respect to their physical functioning. Non-usersachieve significantly higher scores on the scale ""scepticism""(PAREMO-20) than users (eta(2)=0.19). The scale ""scepticism"" is alsoidentified as the dominant predictor of utilization of rehabilitationservices (R-2=0.23). Suffering from comorbid diseases of the digestivesystem, self-efficacy expectation and employment status emerge asfurther significant predictors (R-2=0.12, and R-2=0.02 each). Withincreasing scepticism and in case of comorbidity the probability ofrehabilitation utilization was decreasing.Conclusion: Besides illness-related variables prostate cancer patients'expectancies regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation services toalleviate their medical conditions seem to be more relevant forrehabilitation utilization than sociodemographic variables orpsychosocial distress. Further studies should investigate thereplicability of these results and should focus on thedoctor-patient-communication and the amount of information about goalsand concepts of rehabilitation services prostate cancer patients aretold. For clinical practice of information-giving about rehabilitationservices it can be recommended not only to assess patients' physical andmental conditions but also to explore their expectations and concernsabout rehabilitative treatment options in order to remove any doubts andto be able to optimize oncological care."," 10.1055/s-0031-1285893"," 2012"

We tested nine symptom dimensions derived from a previouslypublished factor analysis of depression rating scales as predictors ofoutcome in 811 adults with moderate to severe depression treated withflexibly dosed escitalopram or nortriptyline in Genome-based TherapeuticDrugs for Depression (GENDEP). The effects of symptom dimensions weretested in mixed-effect regression models that controlled for overallinitial depression severity, age, sex and recruitment centre.Significant results were tested for replicability in 3637 adultout-patients with non-psychotic major depression treated with citalopramin level I of Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression(STAR*D).Results. The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting lowinterest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) atbaseline strongly predicted poor treatment outcome in GENDEP,irrespective of overall depression severity, antidepressant type andoutcome measure used. The prediction of poor treatment outcome by theinterest-activity dimension was robustly replicated in STAR*D,independent of a comprehensive list of baseline covariates.Conclusions. Loss of interest, diminished activity and inability to makedecisions predict poor outcome of antidepressant treatment even afteradjustment for overall depression severity and other clinicalcovariates. The prominence of such symptoms may require additionaltreatment strategies and should be accounted for in futureinvestigations of antidepressant response."," 10.1017/S0033291711001905"," 2012"

First,peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system inwhich reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensuresaccountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality ofreviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews maymove to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of dataensures the possibility of independent verification of inferentialclaims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overlypositive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits ofthe sestrategies by discussing an example in which the classicalpublication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research.

" J"," Hartshorne, Joshua K.Schachner, Adena"," Tracking replicability as a method of post-publication open evaluation"," FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE"," Recent reports have suggested that many published results areunreliable. To increase the reliability and accuracy of publishedpapers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes instatistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe thatthe incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for suchreforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality ofindividual scientists is judged on the basis of their number ofpublications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbersof citations. Neither of these measures takes into account thereplicability of the published findings, as false or controversialresults are often particularly widely cited. We propose trackingreplications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to helpresearchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize thepublication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires adatabase linking published studies that replicate one another. As anysuch database is limited by the number of replication attemptspublished, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated topublishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database andthe affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination ofcrowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database areaggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicabilityscores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate thequality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we layout a detailed description of how this system could be implemented,including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring dataquality, and incentivizing the research community to participate."," 10.3389/fncom.2012.00008"," 2012"

These four conceptscan serve as a foundation to evaluate archaeological sourcing data andprocedures, but adoption of Hughes' framework has been nearlynonexistent.

In that investigation,confirmatory factor analysis found that a model with those 5 factors fitthe data best and fit equally well for native and non-native Englishspeakers. The study included 486 students, 334 born or educated in theUnited States (native) and 152 not born nor educated in the US(non-native) but who spoke English well enough to participate in Englishreading classes. The cluster analysis found an 8-cluster solution withgood internal cohesion, external isolation, and replicability acrosssubsamples. Of the 8 subgroups, 4 had relatively flat profiles (range ofmean scores across factors < 0.5 SD), 2 had higher comprehension thandecoding, and 2 had higher decoding than comprehension. Profiles wereconsistent with expectations regarding demographic factors. Non-nativespeakers were overrepresented in subgroups with relatively higherdecoding and underrepresented in subgroups with relatively highercomprehension.

In this paper, we argue thatmany of the difficulties facing CNS drug discovery stem from a lack ofrobustness in pre-clinical (i.e., non-human animal) testing. There aretwo main sources for this lack of robustness. First, there is the lackof replicability of many results from the pre-clinical stage, which weargue is driven by a combination of publication bias and inappropriateselection of statistical and experimental designs. Second, there is thefrequent failure to translate results in non-human animals to parallelresults in humans in the clinic. This limitation can only be overcome bydeveloping new behavioral tests for non-human animals that havepredictive, construct, and etiological validity. Here, we present thesetranslational difficulties as a ""grand challenge"" to researchers fromcomparative cognition, who are well positioned to provide new methodsfor testing behavior and cognition in non-human animals. These newexperimental protocols will need to be both statistically robust andtarget behavioral and cognitive processes that allow for betterconnection with human CNS disorders. Our hope is that this downturn inindustrial research may represent an opportunity to develop newprotocols that will re-kindle the search for more effective and saferdrugs for CNS disorders.

The use of manualized treatment programs offers a usefulresearch framework for assessing psychotherapeutic interventions forfemale sexual dysfunctions (FSDs), but it does not address all issuesrelated to methodological rigor and replication, and raises new researchissues in need of discussion.Aims. The goals of this manuscript are to review the literature ontreatment trials utilizing manualized psychotherapy treatments for FSDand to explore the benefits and research issues associated with theflexible use of treatment manuals.Methods. The method used was the review of the relevant literature.Results. While the use of manualized treatments for FSDs can addresscertain methodological issues inherent in psychotherapy research,flexibility in manual administration is necessary in order to allowtailoring for individual needs that can be beneficial to both theparticipant and the research. The flexible use of manuals, as opposed tostrict manual adherence, may also be more relevant for clinical utility.Conclusions. In order to administer manualized treatments for FSDs withappropriate flexibility, while also maximizing internal validity andreplicability, the authors recommend that predetermined decision rulesbe utilized to guide individual tailoring, that potential gaps in themanual be identified and addressed, and that differing levels ofmotivation and readiness for treatment be taken into consideration inthe treatment protocol.

Unfortunately, and as a result of uncontrolledmaintenance, information systems age over time until it is necessary toreplace them with new and modernized systems. However, while systems areaging, meaningful business knowledge that is not present in any of theorganization's other assets gradually becomes embedded in them. Thepreservation of this knowledge through the recovery of the underlyingbusiness processes is, therefore, a critical problem. This paperprovides, as a solution to the aforementioned problem, a model-drivenprocedure for recovering business processes from legacy informationsystems. The procedure proposes a set of models at different abstractionlevels, along with the model transformations between them. The paperalso provides a supporting tool, which facilitates its adoption.Moreover, a real-life case study concerning an e-government systemapplies the proposed recovery procedure to validate its effectivenessand efficiency.

Several commercial WiFi positioning systems havebeen developed in recent years and most newer model smart phones havethe technology embedded. This study empirically determined theperformance of WiFi positioning system on two different mobile devices.Skyhook's system, running on an iPhone and a laptop, was selected forthis study. Field work was carried out in three cities at a total of 90sites. The positional accuracy of WiFi positioning was found to be verysimilar on the two devices with no statistically significant differencebetween the two error distributions. This suggests that thereplicability of WiFi positioning on different devices is high based onaggregate performance metrics. Median values for positional accuracy inthe three study areas ranged from 43 to 92 m. These results are similarto earlier independent evaluations of Skyhook's system. The number ofaccess points (APs) observed on the iPhone was consistently lower thanthat on the laptop. This lower number of APs, however, was not found toreduce positional accuracy. In general, no relationship was foundbetween the number of APs and positional accuracy for either device,counter to earlier findings. The results indicate, however, that WiFipositioning can be achieved with a small number of APs (5-10), but thatincreased numbers of APs do not contribute to improved positionalaccuracy. Despite the agreement in aggregate performance metrics betweenthe two devices, the replicability of WiFi positioning using Skyhook'ssystem in terms of getting the same location by using two differentdevices at approximately the same place and time was relatively poor.Implications for location-based services on mobile devices arediscussed."," 10.1080/17489725.2011.630038"," 2012"

Sequenced reproductions of ambiguous stimuli showedprogressive object-likeness. As Bartlett pointed out, activation ofspecific schemata, for instance ""the face schema"", biases memoryretrieval towards such schemata. In five experiments (Experiment 1, n =53; Experiment 2, n = 177; Experiment 3, n = 36; Experiment 4, n = 6;Experiment 5, n = 2), we tested several factors potentially influencingretrieval biases-for example, by varying the general procedure ofreproduction (repeated vs. serial) and by omitting versus providingvisual or semantic cues for activating face schemata. Participantsinspected face-like stimuli with the caption ""portrait of the human"" andreproduced them repeatedly under specific conditions. None of theexperiments revealed a systematic tendency towards Bartlett's describedcase, even when the participants were explicitly instructed to draw ""aface"" like the previously inspected one. In one of the ""serialreproduction"" experiments, we even obtained contrary effects withdecreasing face-likeness over the reproduction generations.

Literature reviews in the field of supply chainmanagement (SCM) are often considerably less stringently presented thanother empirical research. Replicability of the research and traceabilityof the arguments and conclusions call for more transparent andsystematic procedures. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on theimportance of literature reviews in SCM.Design/methodology/approach - Literature reviews are defined asprimarily qualitative synthesis. Content analysis is introduced andapplied for reviewing 22 literature reviews of seven sub-fields of SCM,published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and2009. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by acontent analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analyticcategories derived from a typical research process.Findings - Each paper was assessed for the aim of research, the methodof data gathering, the method of data analysis, and quality measures.While some papers provide information on all of these categories, manyfail to provide all the information. This questions the quality of theliterature review process and the findings presented in respectivepapers.Research limitations/implications - While 22 literature reviews aretaken into account in this paper as the basis of the empirical analysis,this allows for assessing the range of procedures applied in previousliterature reviews and for pointing to their strengths and shortcomings.Originality/value - The findings and subsequent methodologicaldiscussions aim at providing practical guidance for SCM researchers onhow to use content analysis for conducting literature reviews."," 10.1108/13598541211258609"," 2012"

It offers a threedimensional framework of research methodology that spans the assumeddivide and shows that quantitative and qualitative research approachescan be mutually complementary and offer a more nuanced approximation ofthe truth. The framework, Research methodology in 3D, is based on ameta-methodological analysis and consists of three root dimensions,namely, firstly, four constituent components presented in all forms ofresearch (concepts, questions/hypotheses, observation/measurement andcommunication). The second dimension of the framework consists of thecore set of criteria that all scientific research must comply with(reliability, validity, 'objectivity' and replicability), each may beexpressed under different labels and in different forms depending on thespecific research tradition. The third dimension represents the basicgoals of research, viz. to describe, to explain or to understand. Athree dimensional framework emerges when the above dimensions arecombined. The framework shows some of the tangent planes betweenquantitative and qualitative scientific research and suggests possiblecomplementarity between research approaches. The framework furthermoreserves at least the following functions: firstly, as map to assiststudents in charting their way through a maze of new concepts. Secondly,the framework is a useful planning instrument for comprehensive andcomplex research programmes.

All of them organizetheir working structure to perform computerized experiments based onexplicit research protocols and evidence. The benefits have been manyand great advancements are continuously obtained for the society.However, could the same approach be observed in Software Engineering(SE)? Are there research protocols and evidence based models availablein SE for supporting SBS? Are the studies reports good enough to supporttheir understanding and replication? AIM: To characterize SBS in SE andorganize a set of reporting guidelines aiming at improving SBS'understandability, replicability, generalization and validity. METHOD:To undertake a secondary study to characterize SBS. Besides, to assessthe quality of reports to understand the usually reported informationregarding SBS. RESULTS: From 108 selected papers, it has been observedseveral relevant initiatives regarding SBS in software engineering.However, most of the reports lack information concerned with theresearch protocol, simulation model building and evaluation, used data,among others. SBS results are usually specific, making theirgeneralization and comparison hard. No reporting standard has beenobserved. CONCLUSIONS: Advancements can be observed in SBS in SoftwareEngineering. However, the lack of reporting consistency can reduceunderstandability, replicability, generalization and compromise theirvalidity. Therefore, an initial set of guidelines is proposed aiming atimproving SBS report quality.

They seek to evaluate how different factors impactduring the initiation and implementation phases of the adoption process.Design/methodology/approach - The authors base the methodologicalapproach on two exploratory case studies with a contrasting resultlogic. They build a multi-level framework grounded both on literaturereview, and feedback from stakeholders. They then apply the framework totwo case studies to better frame the findings. They consider phases ofadoption (initiation, implementation) and the levels of adoption(technological, organizational, environmental, individual).Findings - In the case studies, the authors found the importance of astrong and decision-centric management board to give the impulse for theinitiation phase of the process. As perceived by the stakeholders, astrong governmental support is of paramount importance to increase theadoption at the public level, although in the case studies examined theinitiation stage started from the impulse of a championing management.Both case studies passed the initiation phase successfully. Continuousemployees' training, organizational objectives consensus, and businessprocess reengineering have been found important for the implementationphase. In the case study in which these factors were not in place, theimplementation phase of adoption failed. Environmental factors -although relevant for the initiation of the adoption process - are lesssignificant during the actual implementation of the adoption process, asthe contrasting result logic from the case studies shows.Research limitations/implications - The study refers to two publicorganizations in a specific environmental setting. No causality amongfactors has been inferred. Quantitative objective data have been used todetermine the success of adoption, for qualitative data multiple sourceshave been used when possible to limit threats to validity.Practical implications - The framework can be used by stakeholders inpublic organizations to better frame their adoption strategies and tocompare results across institutions. Lessons learnt from the casestudies can be useful to drive future adoptions of FLOSS.Originality/value - The framework combines phases of adoption and levelsmaking it possible to frame the analysis of the case studies. It hasbeen operationalized with a set of metrics, and with a protocol for thecase studies to increase replicability value."," 10.1108/09593841211232677"," 2012"

People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been identifiedas significantly more disabled in ET use compared to controls, albeitless disabled than people with dementia. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the replicability of these findings using an improvedversion of the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) to compareperceptions of relevance and difficulty in ET use in participants withMCI or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. Additional aims were toexplore the validity of ETUQ, and the relationships between perceiveddifficulty in ET use and cognitive status, mood state, and involvementin everyday life activities. In total, 118 participants were included,37 with AD, 37 with MCI, and 44 controls.Results: Analyses confirmed that the rating scale of the ETUQ functionedwell. The three groups overlapped but differed significantly in theirperceptions of ETs relevance (p<0.05) as well as of difficulties in ETuse (p<0.001). Moderate correlations were also found between ETUQmeasures and cognitive status, mood, and involvement in activities, thestrongest being that between ETUQ measures and involvement in activities(r=0.563).Conclusion: Taken together, the findings underscore the plausibility ofdisability already in people with MCI, as the use of ET stronglycorrelates to involvement in activities. It is therefore important thatprofessionals who meet older adults with cognitive impairment take thisaspect of function into account in assessments and targetedinterventions."," 10.1080/13607863.2011.605055"," 2012"

In order to tackle the problem, State governmentinstalled several rural water supply schemes in the past, but effortscould not yield desired results due to lack of community participationin operation and maintenance of these schemes. Few years back, Stategovernment with funding support from World Bank installed Rural WaterSupply and Environmental Sanitation Projects with NGOs and communitysupport. The idea was that with the installation of such projects, timeused in water collection would be considerably saved which a ruralhousehold can utilise in economic activities to earn additional income.The total income, thus, earned would provide an economic advantage whensuch benefits exceeded the costs incurred in these projects. Theanalysis in the paper focused on two issues. (i) The situationalanalysis of various dimensions of drinking water collection in theState.

However, in mesocosmstudies, the number of replicates is limited by practical and financialconstraints. In addition, high levels of biological organization arecharacterized by a high variability of descriptive variables. Thisvariability and the poor number of replicates have been recognized as amajor drawback for detecting significant effects of chemicals inmesocosm studies. In this context, a tool able to predict preciselycontrol mesocosms outputs, to which endpoints in mesocosms exposed tochemicals could be compared should constitute a substantial improvement.We evaluated here a solution which consists in stochastic modelling ofthe control fish populations to assess the probabilistic distributionsof population endpoints. An individual-based approach was selected,because it generates realistic fish length distributions and accountsfor both individual and environmental sources of variability. Thisstrategy was applied to mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) populationsmonitored in lentic mesocosms. We chose the number of founders as aso-called ""stressor"" because subsequent consequences at the populationlevel could be expected. Using this strategy, we were able to detectmore significant and biologically relevant perturbations than usingclassical methods. We conclude that designing an individual-based modelis very promising for improving mesocosm data analysis.

The Global Plan aspires to reduce new HIV infections amongchildren by 90 percent, and to reduce AIDS-related maternal mortality byhalf. This article summarizes the results of a review commissioned byUNAIDS to help inform stakeholders on promising practices in communityengagement to accelerate progress towards these ambitious goals.METHODS: This research involved extensive literature review and keyinformant interviews. Community engagement was defined to includeparticipation, mobilization and empowerment while excluding activitiesthat involve communities solely as service recipients. A promisingpractice was defined as one for which there is documented evidence ofits effectiveness in achieving intended results and some indication ofreplicability, scale up and/or sustainability.RESULTS: Promising practices that increased the supply of preventingmother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services included extendingcommunity cadres, strengthening linkages with community- and faith-basedorganizations and civic participation in programme monitoring. Practicesto improve demand for PMTCT included community-led social and behaviourchange communication, peer support and participative approaches togenerate local solutions. Practices to create an enabling environmentincluded community activism and government leadership for greaterinvolvement of communities. Committed leadership at all levels,facility, community, district and national, is crucial to success.Genuine community engagement requires a rights-based, capacity-buildingapproach and sustained financial and technical investment. Participativeformative research is a first step in building community capacity andhelps to ensure programme relevance. Building on existing structures,rather than working in parallel to them, improves programme efficiency,effectiveness and sustainability. Monitoring, innovation and informationsharing are critical to scale up.CONCLUSIONS: Ten recommendations on community engagement are offered forending vertical transmission and enhancing the health of mothers andfamilies: (1) expand the frontline health workforce, (2) increaseengagement with community- and faith-based organizations, (3) engagecommunities in programme monitoring and accountability, (4) promotecommunity-driven social and behaviour change communication includinggrassroots campaigns and dialogues, (5) expand peer support, (6) empowercommunities to address programme barriers, (7) support communityactivism for political commitment, (8) share tools for communityengagement, (9) develop better indicators for community involvement and(10) conduct cost analyses of various community engagement strategies.As programmes expand, care should be taken to support and not toundermine work that communities are already doing, but rather toactively identify and build on such efforts."," 10.7448/IAS.15.4.17390"," 2012"

Compared to participants insmaller panels, those in larger panels were more likely to agree thatthey had debated each others' view points.Conclusion: It is feasible to conduct online expert panels intended tofacilitate consensus finding among geographically distributedparticipants. The online approach may be practical for engaging largeand diverse groups of stakeholders around a range of health servicesresearch topics and can help conduct multiple parallel panels to testfor the reproducibility of panel conclusions."," 10.1186/1471-2288-11-174"," 2011"

The accumulation of MMN was modeled empirically with respectto measurement error, and repeatability was estimated at 0.6-3.5-mu Verror levels. The analysis was made for the results in the singledeviant conditions and their pattern (auditory discrimination profile).Results: At the single-subject level, the measurement errorsignificantly affected the repeatability until it went below 9-17% ofMMN peak amplitude. At the group level, the threshold was higher. Peakamplitude was generally the most repeatable parameter. Latency wassuperior when the error was moderate or small (<2-3 mu V).Conclusions: The measurement error affects the repeatability of MMN. Insingle-subject studies, it should not be neglected if it exceeds 10% ofthe MMN amplitude. The application of the auditory discriminationprofile is recommended for future applications.Significance: The study provided quantitative results to support thediscussion on improving the repeatability of the MMN measurements.

Lessons from four cities inMozambique"," WATER SA"," In the void left by the declining popularity of public-privatepartnerships, the concept of 'water operator partnerships' (WOPs) hasincreasingly been promoted as an alternative for improving waterservices provision in developing countries. This paper assesses thepotential of such partnerships as a 'model' for contributing to theMDGs, by focusing on 4 water utilities in Mozambique. Although, thestudy found these partnerships to be successful, it is more scepticalabout the potential for this type of water operator partnership tosignificantly contribute towards achieving the MDGs. The main reason forthis is that the replicability of the partnership-model studied inMozambique was found to be quite limited. The case presented in thisarticle highlights 3 main lessons for water operator partnerships in thewater services sector. First, the availability of investment funds is acrucial component of a partnership. Without access to such funds theimpact of such a partnership is likely to be limited. Secondly, thelevel of commitment to the partnership needs to be high if it is to besuccessful. This commitment is likely to take shape in the form of bothfinancial commitment as well as commitment of time and effort of theorganisations involved. Thirdly, even if the partnership is a success,the question of how sustainable the achieved performance gains areremains a point of concern. All in all, although we acknowledge thesuccess achieved by the studied partnership, the findings have made ushesitant about the potential for replicating this 'model' at a largescale."," 10.4314/wsa.v37i4.17"," 2011"
" J"," Stoltzfus, Jill C."," Logistic Regression: A Brief Primer"," ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE"," Regression techniques are versatile in their application to medicalresearch because they can measure associations, predict outcomes, andcontrol for confounding variable effects. As one such technique,logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze theeffect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome byquantifying each independent variable's unique contribution. Usingcomponents of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logisticregression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination ofvariables with the greatest probability of detecting the observedoutcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regressioninclude selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevantassumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model buildingstrategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided bysuch factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations,clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, withacknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should beaccounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logisticregression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit forcontinuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of stronglyinfluential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate numberof events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, withcommonly recommended minimum ""rules of thumb"" ranging from 10 to 20events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the threegeneral types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, andstepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose.Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of thesemethods, one should formally quantify the model's internal validity(i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity(i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resultinglogistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is assessedusing various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized bya smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use ofdiagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacyof the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typicallyreported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2011; 18:1099-1104 (C) 2011 by the Societyfor Academic Emergency Medicine"," 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2011.01185.x"," 2011"

An approach based in intersubjective systems theorycan address this problem. The writings of Robert Stolorow (2007) inTrauma and Human Existence, which the author first read while deployedto Iraq as a psychiatrist, fundamentally changed his understanding oftrauma and its treatment. The author gives an overview of Stolorow'sideas about trauma, and then describes his six-phase short-termintersubjective treatment approach. Extensive case material from atreatment that occurred in Iraq illustrates each of these phases. Theauthor then compares his and Stolorow's views to those of othercontemporary relational psychoanalytic writers. Future directionsinclude the manualization and empirical testing of this approach inorder to determine its replicability, its utility for therapists wholack extensive psychoanalytic training, and its generalizability topopulations with adult-onset trauma outside the military."," 10.1037/a0024174"," 2011"

Nitrogen recommendations from RampAnalyzer 1.2 are not correlated even for strips that were placed side byside, and recommendations from strips in the same field show no morehomogeneity than randomly selected strips throughout the county.

Multimicronutrient interventions for groups with higher needsmay include home fortification products for young children orsupplements for pregnant and lactating women. The choice of preparationshould be guided by target group needs, evidence of efficacy of aproduct or its compounds, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.Different designs can be used to assess whether an intervention has thedesired impact. First, program implementation and adherence must beascertained. Then, impact on micronutrient status can be assessed, butdesign options are often limited by logistic challenges, availablebudget, security issues, and ethical and practical issues regardingnonintervention or placebo groups. Under these conditions, aplausibility design using pre- and post-intervention cross-sectionalsurveys, a prospective cohort study, or a step-wedge design, whichenrolls groups as they start receiving the intervention, should beconsidered. Post hoc comparison of groups with different adherencelevels may also be useful. Hemoglobin is often selected as an impactindicator because it is easily measured and tends to respond to changein micronutrient status, especially iron. However, it is not a veryspecific indicator of micronutrient status, because it is alsoinfluenced by inflammation, parasitic infestation, physiological status(age, pregnancy), altitude, and disorders such as thalassemia and sicklecell disease.Conclusion.

Within this model, we analyze theprobability of successfully replicating an initial experimental resultby obtaining either a statistically significant result in the samedirection or any effect in that direction. We analyze both theprobability of successfully replicating a particular experimental effect(i.e., the individual replication probability) and the averageprobability of successful replication across different studies withinsome research context (i.e., the aggregate replication probability), andwe identify the conditions under which the latter can be approximatedusing the formulas of Killeen (2005a, 2007). We show how both of theseprobabilities depend on parameters of the research context that wouldrarely be known in practice. In addition, we show that the statisticaluncertainty associated with the size of an initial observed effect wouldoften prevent accurate estimation of the desired individual replicationprobability even if these research context parameters were knownexactly. We conclude that accurate estimates of replication probabilityare generally unattainable."," 10.1037/a0023347"," 2011"

Usingfeeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosidspiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNAdetection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in theirsensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection amongindividual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that haddigested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening allpredators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease inprey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperaturesby 4 degrees C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detectionrates in both predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualizationmethods, an eightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeatedscreening of predators increased the total number of samples scoringpositive, although the proportion of samples testing positive did notvary significantly between different PCRs. The present findingsdemonstrate that assay sensitivity, in combination with othermethodological factors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophicinteraction data. Future work employing molecular prey detection shouldthus consider and minimize the methodologically induced variation thatwould also allow for better cross-study comparisons."," 10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.03018.x"," 2011"

The 39-item Five FacetMindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) has been developed as a reliable andvalid comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects ofmindfulness in community and student samples. In this study, thepsychometric properties of the Dutch FFMQ were assessed in a sample of376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and byrelating the FFMQ to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being,experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism andopenness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the FFMQ(FFMQ-SF) was developed and assessed in the same sample andcross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia.Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for acorrelated five-factor structure of the FFMQ and good model fit for thestructure of the FFMQ-SF. The replicability of the five-factor structureof the FFMQ-SF was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Bothinstruments proved highly sensitive to change.

In this paper, we aimed to clarify differences between bipolardisorder and schizophrenia by combining fMRI (collected during anauditory oddball task) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Weproposed a fusion method, ""multimodal CCA+ joint ICA"", which increasesflexibility in statistical assumptions beyond existing approaches andcan achieve higher estimation accuracy. The data collected from 164participants (62 healthy controls, 54 schizophrenia and 48 bipolar) wereextracted into ""features"" (contrast maps for fMRI and fractionalanisotropy (FA) for DTI) and analyzed in multiple facets to investigatethe group differences for each pair-wised groups and each modality.Specifically, both patient groups shared significant dysfunction indorsolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus, as well as reduced whitematter (WM) integrity in anterior thalamic radiation and uncinatefasciculus. Schizophrenia and bipolar subjects were separated byfunctional differences in medial frontal and visual cortex, as well asWM tracts associated with occipital and frontal lobes. Both patients andcontrols showed similar spatial distributions in motor and parietalregions, but exhibited significant variations in temporal lobe.Furthermore, there were different group trends for age effects onloading parameters in motor cortex and multiple WM regions, suggestingthat brain dysfunction and WM disruptions occurred in identified regionsfor both disorders. Most importantly, we can visualize an underlyingfunction structure network by evaluating the joint components withstrong links between DTI and fMRI. Our findings suggest that althoughthe two patient groups showed several distinct brain patterns from eachother and healthy controls, they also shared common abnormalities inprefrontal thalamic WM integrity and in frontal brain mechanisms.

Whether such a gene combination could result in thepathogenicity and transmission as H1N1/2009 virus remains unclear. Inthe present study, we used reverse genetics to construct a reassortantvirus (rH1N1) with the same gene combination as H1N1/2009 virus (NA andM genes from a Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and another sixgenes from a North American triple-reassortant H1N2 swine virus).Characterization of rH1N1 in mice showed that this virus had higherreplicability and pathogenicity than those of the seasonal human H1N1and Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 viruses, but was similar to theH1N1/2009 and triple-reassortant H1N2 viruses. Experiments performed onguinea pigs showed that rH1N1 was not transmissible, whereas pandemicH1N1/2009 displayed efficient transmissibility. To further determinewhich gene segment played a key role in transmissibility, we constructeda series of reassortants derived from rH1N1 and H1N1/2009 viruses.Direct contact transmission studies demonstrated that the HA and NSgenes contributed to the transmission of H1N1/2009 virus. Second, the HAgene of H1N1/2009 virus, when combined with the H1N1/2009 NA gene,conferred efficient contact transmission among guinea pigs.

A 'pilotstudy' is appropriate only when the number of animals used is a tinyfraction of the numbers that will be invested in the main study becausethe data for the pilot animals cannot legitimately be used again in themain study without increasing the rate of type I errors (falsediscovery).

Mesocosms are used extensively by ecologists to gain a mechanisticunderstanding of ecosystems based on the often untested assumption thatthese systems can replicate the key attributes of natural assemblages.2. Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have exploredcommunity composition, but here for the first time, we extend theapproach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in fouroutdoor channels (4 m2).3. The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverseassemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directedconnectance 0 center dot 09-0 center dot 11). Mesocosm food webstructural attributes were within the range reported for 82well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. Whencompared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine,estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (includingmesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lowermean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship.4. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients fortrivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (-0 center dot 53 to -0 centerdot 49) and individual size distributions (-0 center dot 60 to -0 centerdot 58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems,suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers andresources were realistic approximations.5. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can supportreplicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to'natural' streams. The findings highlight the potential value ofmesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations totest ecological theories, at spatiotemporal scales of relevance tonatural ecosystems."," 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01814.x"," 2011"

Despitethe strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine whatprimary care health providers can do to address their patients' incomeas a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriersto primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in awell-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurancecoverage.Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelve experts onpoverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada. Participantsincluded family physicians, specialist physicians, nurse practitioners,community workers, advocates, policy experts and researchers. Theinterviews were analysed for anticipated and emergent themes.Results: This study reveals provider-and patient-centred structural,attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressing poverty as arisk to health. While many of its findings reinforce previous work inthis area, this study's findings point to a number of areas front lineprimary care providers could target to address their patients' poverty.These include a lack of provider understanding of the lived reality ofpoverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate data about patients'social circumstances, and to the development of inappropriate careplans. Participants also pointed to prejudicial attitudes amongproviders, a failure of primary care disciplines to incorporateapproaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack of knowledge ofconcrete steps providers can take to address patients' poverty.Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourcedjurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence ofsignificant barriers to addressing income as a health issue withinprimary care, the findings point to the possibility of front lineprimary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risksposed by poverty. The consistent direction and replicability of thesefindings point to a refocusing of the research agenda toward anexamination of interventions to decrease the health impacts of poverty."," 10.1186/1471-2296-12-62"," 2011"

Owing to affordability and easyavailability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) isheavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limitedcountries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par withsecond-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions(ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to theinferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrowtherapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamicprofiles, with about 1/3(rd) of the population failing to respond totreatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in responsemay be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expressionof the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transportersand targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable efforthas been made by the scientific community for unraveling this geneticbasis of variable response to AEDs.

Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organismshave been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copynuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method forsequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions usingnext-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems.Results: Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced threechloroplast and two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained twogene copies with up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60individuals across 11 species of Australian Poa grasses. This method hadhigh replicability, a low sequencing error rate (after appropriatequality control) and a low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent ofthe 320 gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80%of individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possiblenuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability.We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poaspecies, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with agroup of American Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allelesharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that thecurrent taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in thetrnH-psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plantbarcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanianand mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure wasdetected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which maybe a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow inthis wind-pollinated group.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 454 sequencing of barcodedamplicon mixtures can be used to reliably sample all alleles ofhomeologous loci in polyploid species and successfully investigatephylogenetic relationships among species, as well as to investigatephylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation sequencing method ismore affordable than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. Itcould be applied to any experiment involving sequencing of ampliconmixtures."," 10.1186/1741-7007-9-19"," 2011"

Process Analysis"," POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE"," This two-article sequence on rubber-assisted embossing was aimed tounderstand the basic mechanisms affecting the pattern uniformity andreplicability and to determine a process window for achieving uniformpatterning and faithful replication. In Part I, the effects of majorprocess and material parameters were identified and studied, andstrategies for successful hot embossing with rubber as a pressure mediumwere proposed. In Part II, the rubber-assisted embossing process wasanalyzed considering the unique rheological behavior of the materialsinvolved to develop useful predictive capabilities for this new process.Specifically, a finite-strain hyperelastic formulation was used forsimulating the isothermal embossing stage, and a generalized Maxwellmodel was used to study the stress relaxation during the holding stageand to predict the elastic recovery after demolding. The rheologicalproperties obtained in Part I were fitted to the constitutive models andimplemented in the simulation procedures. The simulation results agreedwith the major findings in the experimental work and provided a morequantitative insight into the process. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 51:601-608,2011.

The development ofeffective interventions is hampered by the absence of a nomenclature tospecify and report their content. This limits the possibility ofreplicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, andunderstanding the causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. Incontrast, biomedical interventions are precisely specified (e.g., thepharmacological 'ingredients' of prescribed drugs, their dose andfrequency of administration). For most complex interventions, theprecise 'ingredients' are unknown; descriptions (e.g., 'behaviouralcounseling') can mean different things to different researchers orimplementers. The lack of a method for specifying complex interventionsundermines the precision of evidence syntheses of effectiveness, posinga problem for secondary, as well as primary, research.We aim to develop a reliable method of specifying interventioncomponents ('techniques') aimed at changing behaviour.Methods/Design: The research will be conducted in three phases. Thefirst phase will develop the nomenclature. We will refine a preliminarylist of techniques and definitions. Using a formal consensus method,experts will then define the key attributes of each technique and how itrelates to, and differs from, others. They will evaluate the techniquesand their definitions until they achieve an agreed-upon list of clearlydefined, nonredundant techniques. The second phase will test thenomenclature. Trained experts (primary researchers and systematicreviewers), equipped with a coding manual and guidance, will use thenomenclature to code published descriptions of complex interventions.Reliability between experts, over time, and across types of users willbe assessed. We will assess whether using the nomenclature to writeintervention descriptions enhances the clarity and replicability ofinterventions. The third phase will develop a web-based users' resourceof clearly specified and nonredundant techniques, which will aid thescientific understanding of, and development of, effective complexinterventions. Dissemination throughout the project will be throughstakeholder meetings, targeted multidisciplinary workshops, conferencepresentation, journal publication, and publication in an interactiveweb-based platform (a Wiki).Discussion: The development of a reliable method of specifyingintervention components aimed at changing behaviour will strengthen thescientific basis for developing, evaluating, and reporting complexinterventions. It will improve the precision of evidence syntheses ofeffectiveness, thus enhancing secondary, as well as primary, research."," 10.1186/1748-5908-6-10"," 2011"

Knowledge of trends in prevalence is essential to inform thedesign and evaluation of preventive and intervention programmes. Weaimed to assess the prevalence of lifetime sexual violence for bothsexes and to document the prevalence of adult and child abuse by birthyear in the general population. Methods: National cluster-randomizedtelephone interview study of 3120 adults in Ireland was done. Results:Child sexual abuse involving physical contact was reported by 20% ofwomen and 16% of men. In adulthood, figures were 20% and 10% for womenand men, respectively. Prevalence of any form of sexual violence acrossthe lifespan was 42% (women) and 38% (men). Analysis by year of birthindicated a curvilinear pattern for child sexual abuse with lowerprevalence in the oldest and youngest participants. Sexual violence inyoung adulthood showed a linear pattern with higher prevalence in theyoungest participants. Conclusion: The trend of lower rates ofexperience of child sexual abuse in younger adults in the sample is inkeeping with findings from other countries. The trend of higher rates ofadult sexual violence in younger adults is worrying, particularly sincethe same participants reported less experience of child sexual abusethan the preceding generations. There is a paucity of international dataaddressing the issue of cohort differences in exposure to sexualviolence.

However, the intrasubject reliability of this response in bothoptimal and challenging listening conditions has not yet beensystematically documented. This study aimed to evaluate test-retestreliability of the speech-evoked ABR in young adults.Methods: In each of two sessions, ABRs were obtained with: (1) a 170 ms/da/ syllable presented in quiet as well as 2-talker and 6-talker babblebackground noise conditions and (2) a 40 ms /da/ syllable presented inquiet. Test-retest reliability of the responses was analyzed in thefrequency and time domains. Results: The speech-evoked ABR does not varysignificantly across sessions within individuals on measures of temporalencoding (i.e., peak latencies, stimulus-to-response andresponse-to-response measures), frequency representation and responsemagnitude.Conclusions: The subcortical auditory pathway produces a response to acomplex sound that is stable and replicable from session to session.Significance: By demonstrating the high degree of replicability inoptimal and challenging listening conditions, the applicability of thespeech-evoked ABR may be increased to examining a range of auditoryprocessing abilities in clinical and research settings.

More than 51,000 potential associations have been studied andpublished, a figure that keeps increasing, especially with the recentexplosion of array-based Genome-Wide Association Studies. Even if thenumber of true associations described so far is high, many of theputative risk variants detected so far have failed to be consistentlyreplicated and are widely considered false positives. Here, we focus onthe worldwide patterns of replicability of published associationstudies.Results: We report three main findings. First, contrary to previousresults, genes associated to complex diseases present lower degrees ofgenetic differentiation among human populations than average genome-widelevels.

Despite their growing importance,many methodological aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to beconsidered to fully exploit the potential of this approach. Usingfeeding experiments with high alpine carabid beetles and lycosidspiders, we investigated how PCR annealing temperature affects prey DNAdetection success and how post-PCR visualization methods differ in theirsensitivity. Moreover, the replicability of prey DNA detection amongindividual PCR assays was tested using beetles and spiders that haddigested their prey for extended times postfeeding. By screening allpredators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments (range 116-612bp), we found that only in the longest PCR product, a marked decrease inprey detection success occurred. Lowering maximum annealing temperaturesby 4 A°C resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection rates inboth predator taxa. Among the three post-PCR visualization methods, aneightfold difference in sensitivity was observed. Repeated screening ofpredators increased the total number of samples scoring positive,although the proportion of samples testing positive did not varysignificantly between different PCRs. The present findings demonstratethat assay sensitivity, in combination with other methodologicalfactors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust trophic interaction data.Future work employing molecular prey detection should thus consider andminimize the methodologically induced variation that would also allowfor better cross-study comparisons."," http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8947"," 2011"

Owing to affordability and easyavailability, use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) isheavily encouraged for the treatment of epilepsy in resource-limitedcountries such as India. Although first-generation AEDs are at par withsecond-generation AEDs in terms of efficacy, adverse drug reactions(ADRs) are quite common with them. This could be attributed to theinferior pharmacokinetic parameters such as nonlinear metabolism, narrowtherapeutic index and formation of toxic intermediates. In addition,epilepsy patients may differ in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamicprofiles, with about 1/3rd of the population failing to respond totreatment. A proportion of this interindividual variability in responsemay be explained by genetic heterogeneity in the activity and expressionof the network of proteins such as metabolizing enzymes, transportersand targets of AEDs. Over the last two decades, a considerable efforthas been made by the scientific community for unraveling this geneticbasis of variable response to AEDs. However, there have beeninconsistencies in such genetic association studies conducted acrossdifferent territories of the world.

Theanalysis shows different behaviour in translated and non-translatedSpanish: Cualquier(a) is underused as a translation option for'existential' any and acquires a new function, 'negative', which is nota possibility in non-translated language for the same contexts.

To the extent that women's lives and futures areinfluenced by childbirth, access to contraception and safe abortionservices is fundamental to gender equity. Yet many countries legallyrestrict access to safe abortion. In these countries, women with asocioeconomic advantage are more able to circumvent restrictive abortionlaws and access safe abortion services; poor and less educated women aremore likely to use unsafe methods and suffer serious morbidity anddeath. This is particularly egregious as deaths from unsafe abortion areentirely preventable, given access to modern contraception and safeabortion services. Bangladesh's Menstrual Regulation (MR) Programme isan example of a programme with the potential to reduce morbidity andmortality related to unsafe abortion in the context of a restrictiveabortion law. We describe how Bangladesh's MR Programme evolved from anurban-based relief effort in 1972 to a nationwide primary care-levelprogramme; review intersectoral processes that have and continue toinfluence policy development and programme implementation; assess theimpact of the programme; explore contextual factors that have influencedthe potential of the programme over time; and comment on issues ofprogramme sustainability and replicability in settings beyondBangladesh. Available evidence suggests that the MR Programme hascontributed to a reduction in maternal mortality; however, mortalityfrom unsafe abortion continues to disproportionately impact thesocioeconomically disadvantaged.",NA," 2011"

"," BMC Biology"," Background - Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspectivebecause of its immense past impact on evolution and its potential futureimpact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially inplants. Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organismshave been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copynuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method forsequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions usingnext-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems. Results -Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three chloroplast andtwo nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two gene copies withup to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60 individuals across 11species of Australian  Poa grasses. This method had high replicability,a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate quality control) and alow rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of the 320gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80% ofindividuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possiblenuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability. Weapplied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine  Poaspecies, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with agroup of American  Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allelesharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that thecurrent taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the trnH- psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plantbarcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanianand mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure wasdetected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which maybe a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow inthis wind-pollinated group. Conclusions - Our results demonstrate that454 sequencing of barcoded amplicon mixtures can be used to reliablysample all alleles of homeologous loci in polyploid species andsuccessfully investigate phylogenetic relationships among species, aswell as to investigate phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generationsequencing method is more affordable than and at least as reliable asbacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment involvingsequencing of amplicon mixtures.

Further, this study examines books containing the views of eachresearcher, articles reported in design magazines, and academic essaysannounced at conferences. The conclusions of this study are as follows.Firstly, most design researchers merely assert the appropriateness ofthe modernization of traditional aesthetics; as a result, they have notdeveloped design knowledge into a practical stage. Secondly, they havenot connected the results of traditional aesthetics with design-relatedknowledge such as design philosophy, design methodology, and modelingprinciples. Thirdly, designers' practical usage of the traditions has atendency to repeat the visual appearances of traditions. Finally, sincearound 2000, the discourse on Korean traditions has faded away and thediscourse on Asian aesthetics has become active. The characteristics ofthese researches show that design researchers had the intention ofstudying traditions, but the results of their researches indicate a lackof concreteness and thus are unable to be applied to the fields ofdesign practice. In other words, Korean design does not establish Koreandesign principles, design elements, and aesthetics with the requisitereplicability, universality, and science which would enable them to beapplied to educational sites and industrial sites of design.

Despitethe strong evidentiary link, little work has been done to determine whatprimary care health providers can do to address their patients' incomeas a risk to their health. This qualitative study explores the barriersto primary care responsiveness to poverty as a health issue in awell-resourced jurisdiction with near-universal health care insurancecoverage. Methods: One to one interviews were conducted with twelveexperts on poverty and health in primary care in Ontario, Canada.Participants included family physicians, specialist physicians, nursepractitioners, community workers, advocates, policy experts andresearchers. The interviews were analysed for anticipated and emergentthemes. Results: This study reveals provider- and patient-centredstructural, attitudinal, and knowledge-based barriers to addressingpoverty as a risk to health. While many of its findings reinforceprevious work in this area, this study's findings point to a number ofareas front line primary care providers could target to address theirpatients' poverty. These include a lack of provider understanding of thelived reality of poverty, leading to a failure to collect adequate dataabout patients' social circumstances, and to the development ofinappropriate care plans. Participants also pointed to prejudicialattitudes among providers, a failure of primary care disciplines toincorporate approaches to poverty as a standard of care, and a lack ofknowledge of concrete steps providers can take to address patients'poverty. Conclusions: While this study reinforces, in a well-resourcedjurisdiction such as Ontario, the previously reported existence ofsignificant barriers to addressing income as a health issue withinprimary care, the findings point to the possibility of front lineprimary care providers taking direct steps to address the health risksposed by poverty.

Analysis of a number of variables(e.g., physical, behavioral, and cognitive) shows that fetal exposure tonicotine does not consistently cause growth retardation or decreasedbirth weight, nor reliably affect motor activity. But combined pre- andneonatal exposure is likely to result in delayed reflex development,global impairments in learning and memory, and an increased incidence ofsymptoms that model psychiatric illness. There is also support forincreased self-administration of nicotine and other drugs of abuse inanimals exposed developmentally to nicotine, as well as potent effectson offspring responses to drug challenges.

Four genes (oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2),tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), andKIT ligand (KITLG)) implicated in human skin-color variation, have shownevidence for positive selection in Europeans and East Asians in previousSNP-scan data. In the current study, we resequenced 4.7 to 6.7 kb of DNAfrom each of these genes in Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and SouthAsians.RESULTS: Applying all commonly used neutrality-test statistics forallele frequency distribution to the newly generated sequence dataprovided conflicting results regarding evidence for positive selection.Previous haplotype-based findings could not be clearly confirmed.Although some tests were marginally significant for some populations andgenes, none of them were significant after multiple-testing correction.Combined P values for each gene-population pair did not improve theseresults. Application of Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov chainMonte Carlo based to these sequence data using a simple forwardsimulator revealed broad posterior distributions of the selectiveparameters for all four genes, providing no support for positiveselection. However, when we applied this approach to published sequencedata on SLC45A2, another human pigmentation candidate gene, we couldreadily confirm evidence for positive selection, as previously detectedwith sequence-based and some haplotype-based tests.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that even genes that are strongbiological candidates for positive selection and show reproduciblesignatures of positive selection in SNP scans do not always show thesame replicability of selection signals in other tests, which should beconsidered in future studies on detecting positive selection in geneticdata."," 10.1186/2041-2223-2-24"," 2011"

However, there are severalcontroversies in transition research, including, the role of agency intransitions; the relationships between levels (niche, regime andlandscapes); the origin of transitions; the identification of atransition, including starting and ending point of transition processes;and the paradox of replicability and scaling up of independentexperiments. We argue that transition research, and future studies canbenefit from taking complexity theory seriously. In the paper, weelaborate four insights from complexity studies that can move theresearch agenda of transition studies forward: empirically investigatingthe degree of complexity of a system; investigating complexity at thelevel of the policy-making system; longitudinal and retrospectiveresearch designs for the identification of transitions; methodologicaltools which accommodate complexity, such as agent-based modeling andARIMA modeling.

Aquestionnaire, consisting of five general questions (sex, age, age attime of acute polio, sequelae of polio, and new symptoms), the FSS, andthree questions from the Visual Analog Scale questions on fatigue wassent to all 196 polio survivors at the Institute for Rehabilitation inLjubljana. Responses were assessed in terms of Cronbach's alpha,item-to-total correlation, factor analysis, and Rasch analysis. Of the128 (65.3%) valid questionnaires returned, those presenting no missingvalues were used for subsequent analyses (n = 117). The FSS showed goodinternal consistency: Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.95,item-to-total correlation ranged from 0.68 to 0.88. A reduction fromseven to three rating categories was necessary to comply with criteriafor correct category function. Item difficulty estimates spanned from -0.91 to + 1.09 logits. No item bias was found for sex and age. Theinternal consistency of FSS was high and its item separation reliabilitygood, indicating a satisfactory replicability of item placement in othersamples. In conclusion, Rasch analysis enabled us to confirm thevalidity of FSS (in its 8-item version, without item 1) as a measure ofthe severity and impact of physical symptoms of fatigue in poliosurvivors, so providing a useful starting point for further studiesaimed at examining additional psychometric aspects and confirming theappropriateness of the simplification of its rating categories."," 10.1097/MRR.0b013e32833d6efb"," 2010"

" J"," Goodin, Douglas S."," The genetic basis of multiple sclerosis: a model for MS susceptibility"," BMC NEUROLOGY"," Background: MS-pathogenesis is known to involve both multipleenvironmental events, and several independent genetic risk-factors.Methods: A model of susceptibility is developed and a mathematicalanalysis undertaken to elucidate the nature of genetic susceptibility toMS and to understand the constraints that are placed on the geneticbasis of MS, both by the known epidemiological facts of this disease andby the known frequency of the HLA DRB1*1501 allele in the generalpopulations of northern Europe and North America.Results: For the large majority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, inpart, because an individual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless,2.2% or less of the general population is genetically susceptible.Moreover, from the model, the number of susceptibility-loci that need tobe in a ""susceptible allelic state"" to produce MS-susceptibility issmall (11-18), whereas the total number of such susceptibility-loci islarge (50-200), and their ""frequency of susceptibility"" is low (i.e., <=0.12). The optimal solution to the model equations (which occurs when80% of the loci are recessive) predicts the epidemiological data quiteclosely.Conclusions: The model suggests that combinations of only a small numberof genetic loci in a ""susceptible allelic state"" produceMS-susceptibility. Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies withhundreds of thousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive andfalse-negative identifications and, consequently, emphasis has beenrightly placed on the replicability of findings. Nevertheless, becausegenome-wide screens don't distinguish between true susceptibility-lociand disease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-lociare constrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possibleusing this approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be asuniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MSsusceptibility. Even though the ""frequency of susceptibility"" at the HLADRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of thosesusceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different fromthose that don't. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptibleindividuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only asmall fraction (<= 5.2%) are even susceptible to getting MS."," 10.1186/1471-2377-10-101"," 2010"

The importance of studying replicatereactors is highlighted by the fact that one of the two controls wassignificantly different from the treatment MBRs ( p-value = 0.01, alpha= 0.05) whereas the other one was not (p-value = 0.24, alpha = 0.05).The study suggests that analysis of community dynamics with the rapidSTR approach and with NMS/MRPP can lead to comparable results whentargeting the 16S rRNA gene.

" J"," Boksa, Patricia"," Effects of prenatal infection on brain development and behavior: Areview of findings from animal models"," BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY"," Epidemiological studies with human populations indicate associationsbetween maternal infection during pregnancy and increased risk inoffspring for central nervous system (CNS) disorders includingschizophrenia, autism and cerebral palsy. Since 2000, a large number ofstudies have used rodent models of systemic prenatal infection orprenatal immune activation to characterize changes in brain function andbehavior caused by the prenatal insult. This review provides acomprehensive summary of these findings, and examines consistencies andtrends across studies in an effort to provide a perspective on ourcurrent state of understanding from this body of work. Results fromthese animal modeling studies clearly indicate that prenatal immuneactivation can cause both acute and lasting changes in behavior and CNSstructure and function in offspring. Across laboratories, studies varywith respect to the type, dose and timing of immunogen administrationduring gestation, species used, postnatal age examined and specificoutcome measure quantified. This makes comparison across studies andassessment of rep-licability difficult. With regard to mechanisms,evidence for roles for several acute mediators of effects of prenatalimmune activation has emerged, including circulating interleukin-6,increased placental cytokines and oxidative stress in the fetal brain.However, information required to describe the complete mechanisticpathway responsible for acute effects of prenatal immune activation onfetal brain is lacking, and no studies have yet addressed the issue ofhow acute prenatal exposure to an immunogen is transduced into along-term CNS change in the postnatal animal.

The mathematical analysis shows that the meanextent of the advancement of aging throughout one's life is conserved,or equivalently, the product of the mean life span, T, and the mean rateof aging, (upsilon) over bar (A). is constant, T x (nu) over bar (A)= k.The result is in harmony with our experiences: it accounts for theunlimited replicability of tumor cells, and predicts the prolonged lifespans of hibernating hamsters according to the equation, T congruent toT(chi)=01/1-chi (T(chi=0) is a constant and chi denotes the totalfraction of hibernation periods), in accordance with the Lyman andco-workers experiment. Comparing the present result and the empiricalrelationship between life spans of various mammals and basal metabolicrates, it is suggested that the mean rate of aging is intimatelyconnected with the mean basal metabolic rate. With the help of thisinformation, we inquire the reason of the difference in mean life spansbetween women and men, the result showing that the relative mean lifespan of women to men is T(women)/T(men) congruent to 1.08 for variousnations, which is close to the corresponding relative value of the basalmetabolic rate.

"," Acta Agronomica Sinica"," Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of roots plays animportant role in the genetic mechanism study of root system. A numberof QTLs for root traits have been detected using different populationsin rice ( Oryza sativa L.), but rarely in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.).The ""immortalized F 2"" population is favorable for QTL analysis due toits similar proportions of genotypes in the population, and thereplicability at multiple locations over several years. The objective ofthis study was to detect QTLs for several root traits at seedling stagein wheat. From a set of doubled haploid lines derived from Huapei 3 *Yumai 57, an ""immortalized F 2"" population was constructed with 168single crosses. Wheat seedlings were hydroponically cultured withHoagland's solution in a light incubator, and sampled when the fifthleaf emerged. Nine root traits including root total length, root surfacearea, root average diameter, root volume, root tips, maximum rootlength, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and ratio of root dry weightto shoot dry weight per plant were measured using the WinRHIZO RootAnalysis System. QTLs associated with the nine traits were detectedusing composite interval mapping (CIM) method. A total of seven additiveQTLs and 12 pairs of epistatic QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1D,2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 5D, 6D, and 7D. Additive, dominant and epistaticeffects were observed across these QTLs, including the interactionsbetween additive and additive, additive and dominance, dominance andadditive, as well as dominance and dominance. The phenotypic variationexplained by each QTL ranged from 0.01% to 11.91%. In the intervalbetween  XWMC41 and  XBARC349.2 on chromosome 2D, a QTL for total rootlength and root dry weight was detected. Epistasis was of greatimportance in root growth and development at seedling stage in wheat.The results showed a complex mechanism on the genetics of root traits inwheat, and the eight root traits were significantly correlated with eachother. In marker-assisted breeding practice, several root traits shouldbe considered simultaneously for an integrated performance of roots withproper size and shape. ",NA," 2010"

About 3.6 billion of the world's5.2 billion hectares of dryland used for agriculture have sufferederosion, soil degradation and salination. Desertification can also havea serious impact far beyond the borders of directly affected countries,can hinder efforts for sustainable development and introduces newthreats to human health, ecosystems and national economies. Forcedmigration and potential for inter-state conflict add to the urgency ofthis global problem. Therefore, solutions are desperately needed, suchas the improvement of drought and salinity tolerance of crops. A morerecent idea is to take advantage of the genetic potential of crops stillhave (Glenn et al., 1998). This idea requires to first identifyaccessions of a crop species showing enhanced drought and/or salttolerance. Another promising approach under discussion is to use (xero-)halophytes instead of glycophytic crops or to transfer genes fromhalophytes to regular crops to enhance their salt resistance. Halophytesgrow in a wide variety of saline habitats, from coastal regions, saltmarshes and mudflats to inland deserts, salt flats and steppes (ElShaer, 2003). Halophytes are introduced already at many sites tovalorize highly salinized zones and non-conventional water resourcessuch as waste water. However, the sustainable use of these plantsdepends under osmotic and ionic stress on the ability to exhibit a widerange of responses at molecular, cellular and whole plant levels. Thisincludes the synthesis of compatibles solutes/ osmolytes, specificproteins and radical scavenging mechanisms, ion uptake andcompartmentation of injurious ions. Acclimation of these plants tosalinity depends also upon activation of cascades of molecular networksinvolved to stress sensing, signal transduction and the expression ofspecific stress-related gene and metabolites. The product of these genesmay participate in the generation of regulatory molecules such as planthormones. The deeper understanding and replicability of thephysiological and biochemical basis of drought and salt resistance canprovide a basis for the cultivation of suitable plants in regionsthreatened by desertification and water scarcity sustainable cultureconditions. Even the drylands could offer tangible economic andecological opportunities. The aim of this chapter is to screen theresponses of halophytes with regard to drought and salt resistance toidentify early indicators allowing successful breeding (Koyro et al.,2009)."," 10.1016/S0065-2296(10)53004-0"," 2010"

" J"," Goodin, D. S."," The genetic basis of multiple sclerosis: a model for MS susceptibility."," BMC Neurology"," Background: MS-pathogenesis is known to involve both multipleenvironmental events, and several independent genetic risk-factors.Methods: A model of susceptibility is developed and a mathematicalanalysis undertaken to elucidate the nature of genetic susceptibility toMS and to understand the constraints that are placed on the geneticbasis of MS, both by the known epidemiological facts of this disease andby the known frequency of the HLA DRB1*1501 allele in the generalpopulations of northern Europe and North America. Results: For the largemajority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, in part, because anindividual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless, 2.2% or less of thegeneral population is genetically susceptible. Moreover, from the model,the number of susceptibility-loci that need to be in a ""susceptibleallelic state"" to produce MS-susceptibility is small (11-18), whereasthe total number of such susceptibility-loci is large (50-200), andtheir ""frequency of susceptibility"" is low (i.e., ≤0.12). The optimalsolution to the model equations (which occurs when 80% of the loci arerecessive) predicts the epidemiological data quite closely. Conclusions:The model suggests that combinations of only a small number of geneticloci in a ""susceptible allelic state"" produce MS-susceptibility.Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies with hundreds ofthousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive and false-negativeidentifications and, consequently, emphasis has been rightly placed onthe replicability of findings. Nevertheless, because genome-wide screensdon't distinguish between true susceptibility-loci anddisease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-loci areconstrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possible usingthis approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be asuniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus,this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MSsusceptibility. Even though the ""frequency of susceptibility"" at the HLADRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of thosesusceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different fromthose that don't. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptibleindividuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only asmall fraction ([less than or equal to] 5.2%) are even susceptible togetting MS.",NA," 2010"

Quality assessment tools (QAT) forassessing the study quality examine to what extent study results aresystematically distorted by confounding or bias (internal validity). Thetools can be divided into checklists, scales and component ratings.RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What QAT are available to assess the quality ofinterventional studies or studies in the field of health economics, howdo they differ from each other and what conclusions can be drawn fromthese results for quality assessments?METHODS: A systematic search of relevant databases from 1988 onwards isdone, supplemented by screening of the references, of the HTA reports ofthe German Agency for Health Technology Assessment (DAHTA) and aninternet search. The selection of relevant literature, the dataextraction and the quality assessment are carried out by two independentreviewers. The substantive elements of the QAT are extracted using amodified criteria list consisting of items and domains specific torandomized trials, observational studies, diagnostic studies, systematicreviews and health economic studies. Based on the number of covereditems and domains, more and less comprehensive QAT are distinguished. Inorder to exchange experiences regarding problems in the practicalapplication of tools, a workshop is hosted.RESULTS: A total of eight systematic methodological reviews isidentified as well as 147 QAT: 15 for systematic reviews, 80 forrandomized trials, 30 for observational studies, 17 for diagnosticstudies and 22 for health economic studies. The tools vary considerablywith regard to the content, the performance and quality ofoperationalisation. Some tools do not only include the items of internalvalidity but also the items of quality of reporting and externalvalidity. No tool covers all elements or domains. Design-specificgeneric tools are presented, which cover most of the content criteria.DISCUSSION: The evaluation of QAT by using content criteria isdifficult, because there is no scientific consensus on the necessaryelements of internal validity, and not all of the generally acceptedelements are based on empirical evidence. Comparing QAT with regard tocontents neglects the operationalisation of the respective parameters,for which the quality and precision are important for transparency,replicability, the correct assessment and interrater reliability. QAT,which mix items on the quality of reporting and internal validity,should be avoided.CONCLUSIONS: There are different, design-specific tools available whichcan be preferred for quality assessment, because of its wider coverageof substantive elements of internal validity. To minimise thesubjectivity of the assessment, tools with a detailed and preciseoperationalisation of the individual elements should be applied. Forhealth economic studies, tools should be developed and complemented withinstructions, which define the appropriateness of the criteria. Furtherresearch is needed to identify study characteristics that influence theinternal validity of studies."," 10.3205/hta000085"," 2010"

As ithas been found that growth velocity may be decreased with GnRHatreatment, clinical trials with GnRHa combined with growth hormone (GH)have been carried out. In a recent study 46 adopted girls with early orprecocious puberty were randomly assigned to treatment with either GnRHaor GnRHa combined with GH, and followed to final height (FH). It wasfound that FH was significantly higher in the combined treatment group,158.9 compared with 155.8 cm in the GnRHa treated group. In order toselect the patients who could benefit from added GH, predictions of FHat the start of treatment according to the methods of bone agedetermination of Greulich-Pyle (GP) and Tanner-Whitehouse 2 (TW2) werecompared. It was found that the GP method was the most useful method forpatient selection. Recently, a revision of the Tanner-Whitehouse method,named Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3), has been developed. The present studyexamined the useful-ness of the TW3 method in selecting suitablepatients for combined treatment. Method: The TW3 method bone agedeterminations of the 46 girls were compared to the GP and TW2 methoddeterminations, using the differences between actual FH and predictedadult height (PAH). Beside accuracy of prediction of FH, the criteria ofefficiency of selection and replicability were applied in thecomparison. Results: We found that the GP method, also when compared tothe TW3 method, gave the most accurate prediction of the FH on onlyGnRHa treatment. This gives the best ground for selection of patientswho can benefit from combined treatment. The GP method was also the mostefficient in selecting patients, i.e., it could select the least numberof patients that needed the combined treatment. The only drawback of theGP method was that it requires an experienced pediatric radiologist.Automated methods are being developed and may soon facilitate the use ofthe GP method for those less experienced. The FH after combinedtreatment could be predicted with an equation including PAH GP as wellas PAH TW3 as variables. Conclusion: The GP method remains the mostuseful method for selection of those patients who will benefit most fromthe addition of GH to GnRHa in the treatment of idiopathic centralprecocious or early puberty.

The objectiveof the project is to demonstrate whether alternatives to MB for thetreatment of high moisture dates are technically and economicallyavailable in Algeria and Tunisia as well as in similar conditions andcircumstances.A preliminary investigation of potential pest control techniques waslaunched. Five alternatives were tested in 2008 in a small-scalelaboratory test in France, using 'Deglet Nour' from Biskra, Algeria.The tests have been conducted with limited replicability and withlimited control on efficacy and effect on fruit quality. Furthermore,the environmental conditions were different from the conditions thatmight be expected in north African countries at the time of treatment.Despite the fact that the test provided interesting technicalinformation, it should be considered of limited scientific value.UNIDO presented the results of that preliminary investigation holding atechnical workshop on the replacement of methyl bromide for thedisinfestation of high moisture dates in Vienna (16-17 April 2009).For the time being, two alternatives have been considered promising forthe full scale tests: phosphine without ammonia and high temperatures.The full scale demonstration will be designed to assess the efficacy ofthe two alternatives on all the live stages of pests (in particular oneggs of Lepidoptera) and to assess the effect on fruit quality.Experience has shown that full involvement of local experts andexpertise is needed for the successful preparation, design andimplementation of the activities.",NA," 2010"

Our test was based on 14 traittaxonomies from 12 different languages. Factors were compared at eachlevel of factor extraction with solutions with I to 6 factors. The 294factors in the comparisons were identified using sets of markers of the6-factor model by correlating the marker scales with the factors. Thefactor structures were pairwise compared in each case on the basis ofthe common variables that define the 2 sets of factors. Congruencecoefficients were calculated between the varimax rotated structuresafter Procrustes rotation, where each structure in turn served as atarget to which all other structures were rotated. On the basis ofaverage congruence coefficients of all 91 comparisons, we conclude thatfactor solutions with 3 factors on average are replicable acrosslanguages; solutions with more factors are not."," 10.1037/a0017184"," 2010"

Results revealed that the relative powersdepended on the correlation structure of the simulated repeatedmeasurements. Tests on dropout-weighted linear slope coefficients fittedto all of the available measurements for each participant were found toprovide superior power in the presence of compound symmetry (CS), buttests of significance applied to simple baseline-to-endpoint differencescores provided superior power in the presence of a stronglyautoregressive (AR) correlation structure. Type I error rates appearedin an acceptable range for both of those analyses. Insofar as theprevious study considered only two widely disparate correlationstructures, the present work was undertaken to examine where along acontinuum of correlation structures lying between strongly AR and CS thepower balance shifts from favoring the simple endpoint difference-scoreanalysis to favoring a regression analysis that utilizes all of theavailable repeated measurements for each participant. With powercalculated from the relative frequencies of rejecting Ho at differentlevels of autoregression, the results indicate superior power for thesimple endpoint analysis across more than half the distance fromstrongly AR to CS. To examine replicability of the simulation resultsusing real data from a previously published study, sampling withreplacement from a double-blind controlled study examining the treatmentof depression was used to create a Monte Carlo data set from which powercould be calculated from relative frequencies of rejecting Ho."," 10.1080/00273171.2010.519266"," 2010"

UNIDO took the initiativeto respond to Decision XV/12 and a project proposal was designed todemonstrate the feasibility of alternatives to MB for the post-harvesttreatment of high moisture dates. The objective of the project is todemonstrate whether alternatives to MB for the treatment of highmoisture dates are technically and economically available in Algeria andTunisia as well as in similar conditions and circumstances. Apreliminary investigation of potential pest control techniques waslaunched. Five alternatives were tested in 2008 in a small-scalelaboratory test in France, using 'Deglet Nour' from Biskra, Algeria. Thetests have been conducted with limited replicability and with limitedcontrol on efficacy and effect on fruit quality. Furthermore, theenvironmental conditions were different from the conditions that mightbe expected in north African countries at the time of treatment. Despitethe fact that the test provided interesting technical information, itshould be considered of limited scientific value. UNIDO presented theresults of that preliminary investigation holding a technical workshopon the replacement of methyl bromide for the disinfestation of highmoisture dates in Vienna (16-17 April 2009). For the time being, twoalternatives have been considered promising for the full scale tests:phosphine without ammonia and high temperatures.

Method: Theresearchers recorded the name and number of occurrences of journals thatappeared in the bibliographies of articles published in EAQ and JSL from2000 to 2007. The total counts for EAQ and JSL were combined to reach afinal count. All journals then were rank ordered according to frequency.Findings: Five main findings were noted in the current study. First, itwas found that authors who contribute to these journals tend toreference a different set of periodicals compared to those thatprofessors of educational leadership say they actually read. Second, twoof the leading journals (EAQ and JSL) in the field of educationalleadership may be reaching unique audiences. Third, of the top 25 citedjournals, slightly more than one third of the articles cited in EAQ andJSL from 2000 to 2007 were published in those two journals. Fourth, 4 ofthe top 15 most cited journals are practitioner journals. Finally, thefindings show where educational leadership authors should publish to gettheir work noticed by top scholars in the field. Conclusion: The currentstudy adds a valuable factor influencing authors' choices of journals inwhich to publish their work: a journal's citation frequency.

Methods: In experiment 1 consisting of four conditions with n =15 participants each (control, placebo, two double-blind groups, eachwith placebo only), we maximized the placebo effect through expectation.Effects were assessed with physiological (blood pressure, heart rate),psychomotor (response times), and well-being indicators (self-report).In experiment 2, caffeine was administered in one of the double-blindgroups, and another condition was added where caffeine was given openly.Results Effect sizes were medium to large for some outcome parameters inexperiment 1 and 2, showing partial replicability of the classicalplacebo effect. Although not formally significant, differences betweenthe double blind placebo conditions of the two experiments (with andwithout caffeine present) were medium to small. There was a significantdifference (p = 0.03) between experiment I and experiment 2 in thephysiological variables, and a near significant interaction effectbetween groups and experiments in the physiological variables (p =0.06).Conclusion The question warrants further scrutiny.

The GTM are a panel of 'speedcongenic' mice consisting of over 60 strains spanning the entireautosomal genome. Each strain harbors a small (similar to 23 cM) DBA/2Jdonor segment on a uniform C57BL/6J background. The panel allows formapping to regions as small as 5 cM and provides a powerful new tool forincreasing mapping power and replicability in the analysis of QTLs. Atotal of 97 loci were mapped for a variety of complex behavioral traitsincluding hyperactivity, anxiety, prepulse inhibition, avoidance andconditional fear. A larger number of loci were recovered than generallyattained from standard mapping crosses. In addition, a surprisingly highproportion of loci, 63%, showed phenotypes unlike either of the parentalstrains. These data suggest that epistasis decreases sensitivity oflocus detection in traditional crosses and demonstrate the utility ofthe GTM for mapping complex behavioral traits with high sensitivity andprecision.

" J"," van der Staay, F. JosefArndt, Saskia S.Nordquist, Rebecca E."," Evaluation of animal models of neurobehavioral disorders"," BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS"," Animal models play a central role in all areas of biomedical research.The process of animal model building, development and evaluation hasrarely been addressed systematically, despite the long history of usinganimal models in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders andbehavioral dysfunctions. An iterative, multi-stage trajectory fordeveloping animal models and assessing their quality is proposed. Theprocess starts with defining the purpose(s) of the model, preferentiallybased on hypotheses about brain-behavior relationships. Then, the modelis developed and tested. The evaluation of the model takes scientificand ethical criteria into consideration.Model development requires a multidisciplinary approach. Preclinical andclinical experts should establish a set of scientific criteria, which amodel must meet. The scientific evaluation consists of assessing thereplicability/reliability, predictive, construct and externalvalidity/generalizability, and relevance of the model. We emphasize therole of (systematic and extended) replications in the course of thevalidation process. One may apply a multiple-tiered 'replicationbattery' to estimate the reliability/replicability, validity, andgeneralizability of result.Compromised welfare is inherent in many deficiency models in animals.Unfortunately, 'animal welfare' is a vaguely defined concept, making itdifficult to establish exact evaluation criteria. Weighing the animal'swelfare and considerations as to whether action is indicated to reducethe discomfort must accompany the scientific evaluation at any stage ofthe model building and evaluation process. Animal model building shouldbe discontinued if the model does not meet the preset scientificcriteria, or when animal welfare is severely compromised. Theapplication of the evaluation procedure is exemplified using the ratwith neonatal hippocampal lesion as a proposed model of schizophrenia.In a manner congruent to that for improving animal models, guided by theprocedure expounded upon in this paper, the developmental and evaluationprocedure itself may be improved by careful definition of the purpose(s)of a model and by defining better evaluation criteria, based on theproposed use of the model."," 10.1186/1744-9081-5-11"," 2009"

The state,private and civil sectors have invested in numerous initiativesthroughout the length and breadth of India aimed at extending thebenefits of the information revolution to rural and remote areas. Theserange from Reliance Infocom's roll out of low-cost mobile cellularphones, to numerous civil society based initiatives aimed atestablishing affordable access to information and knowledge. The statecontinues to invest in ICTs for development - from its support forVillage Public Telephones (VPTs) to its enabling the computerisation ofland records such as the Bhoomi project in Karnataka. The state'srecognition of the role played by private and civil society sectors indevelopment marks a major and distinct change in attitude from onecharacterised by `tolerance' at best for these sectors and belief in theself-sufficiency of a `dirigiste' economy, to pragmatic accommodationswith these sectors. This change is to some extent a reflection ofpost-SAP policies adopted by the state, best illustrated by its steadywithdrawal of support from its welfare agenda. While the Bhoomi projectis primarily a state-based project, the Gyan Ganga project is a jointstate-private sector initiative aimed at the use of ICTs in development.Bhoomi, involves the digitalisation of all land records in Karnataka,and the provision of access to these records via information kiosks andfingerprint authentication systems. Gyan Ganga, is an ambitious projectaimed at the provision of information, connectivity, education, e-healthand e-governance broadly with in the parameters of the right toinformation, in the state of Gujarat. Whereas both projects have, atleast on paper, tremendous potential - in the case of Bhoomi, to bypasscorrupt land revenue officers and their power to control access to theserecords, and to bring some transparency in land revenue transactions andrecords, and in the case of Gyan Ganga to bring the multiple benefits ofthe information revolution to the rural masses, both projects, alongwith other similar ICTs for development projects in India, face a rangeof problems. These include issues related to replicability and contentprovision, but also a deeply rooted technological determinism thatassumes that the layering of ICTs in development will automaticallysolve the many issues related to the provision of `access' to thisinformation. In this article I argue that the inability to factor inreal-life contestations in the field, to deal with pre-existingconstraints related to gender, caste, feudalism, privilege andtraditional exercises of power, limits the real potential of ICTs indevelopment. I also argue that the right to information movement inIndia offers pointers towards making e-projects relevant and responsiveto people's real information and knowledge needs.

Method: The ten criteria that were used for reviewingbest practice workplace HIV/AIDS programmes in South Africa includeacceptability, accessibility, ethical soundness, perceived impact,relevance, appropriateness, innovativeness, efficiency, sustainabilityand replicability. Results: More than one-third (35.3%) of the 34 bestpractice workplace interventions identified were found in businesses andindustries in South Africa. This constitutes a significant andencouraging effort to deal with HIV/AIDS in the workplace. Approximately16.7% of the best practice workplace HIV/AIDS interventions focused onpolicy and legal frameworks, 50% of these interventions focused onprevention, 16.7% provided links beyond the workplace and a further16.7% were interventions that focused on knowledge and evidence. A third(33.3%) of practices were found in the mining industry, 16.7% in themotor industry, 16.7% from workers' unions, and the rest (33.3%) werefound in a sugar company, an electricity supply company, apharmaceutical company and the ministry of Public Service andAdministration. Conclusion: It is encouraging that over one-third of allbest practice workplace HIV interventions identified by the ILO expertswere found in South Africa.

CCT programmes have been justified on the grounds thatdemand-side subsidies are necessary to address inequities in access tohealth and social services for poor people. In the past decade they havebecome increasingly popular, particularly in middle income countries inLatin America.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of CCT in improving access to care andhealth outcomes, in particular for poorer populations in low and middleincome countries.Search strategyWe searched a wide range of international databases, including theCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE andEMBASE, in addition to development studies and economic databases. Wealso searched the websites and online resources of numerousinternational agencies, organisations and universities to find relevantgrey literature. The original searches were conducted between November2005 and April 2006. An updated search in MEDLINE was carried out in May2009.Selection criteriaCCT were defined asmonetary transfers made to households on thecondition that they comply with some pre-determined requirements inrelation to health care. Studies had to include an objective measure ofat least one of the following outcomes: health care utilisation, healthexpenditure, health outcomes or equity outcomes. Eligible study designswere: randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis, orcontrolled before-after study of the impact of health financing policiesfollowing criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice andOrganisation of Care Group. Data collection and analysis We performedqualitative analysis of the evidence.Main resultWe included ten papers reporting results from six intervention studies.Overall, design quality and analysis limited the risks of bias. SeveralCCT programmes provided strong evidence of a positive impact on the useof health services, nutritional status and health outcomes, respectivelyassessed by anthropometric measurements and self-reported episodes ofillness. It is hard to attribute these positive effects to the cashincentives specifically because other components may also contribute.Several studies provide evidence of positive impacts on the uptake ofpreventive services by children and pregnant women. We found no evidenceabout effects on health care expenditure.Authors' conclusionsConditional cash transfer programmes have been the subject of somewell-designed evaluations, which strongly suggest that they could be aneffective approach to improving access to preventive services. Theirreplicability under different conditions - particularly in more deprivedsettings - is still unclear because they depend on effective primaryhealth care and mechanisms to disburse payments. Further rigorousevaluative research is needed, particularly where CCTs are beingintroduced in low income countries, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa orSouth Asia."," 10.1002/14651858.CD008137"," 2009"

While this hospital used to be a symbol ofhopelessness among patients and their families and an unspoken shameamong Taiwan psychiatry and mental health circles it now represents anexample of how an old, custodial hospital can be transformed into a verydifferent institution. In this case study we will describe the featuresof this transformation, which, over the past 20 years, has aimed to helpextended stay inpatients with severe mental illness to integrate intothe local community of Yuli even though it is not their original home.METHODS: Using historical documents and oral narratives from Yuliinhabitants, workers and patients of YVH, we will offer a case study ofthe Yuli model.RESULTS: There are four main components of the Yuli model: holisticmedical support, vocational rehabilitation, case management, and theresidential program. The four components help patients recover twoessential features of their lives: vocational life and ordinary dailyroutines. As the process of recovery evolves, patients gradually regaininner stability, dignity, self-confidence, and a sense of control. Thefour components are critical to rebuild the structure and order of lifeof the patients and are indispensable and interdependent parts of oneservice package. They operate simultaneously to benefit the patients tothe greatest degree possible.DISCUSSION: There are many challenges to the further development andfinancial viability of the model of services developed at YVH. There arealso important questions concerning the replicability of the Yuli modelin other sociocultural and service system contexts.CONCLUSION: This case study reveals the possibility of transforming acustodial mental hospital into a hospital providing high quality care.Hospital and community are not in opposition. They are part of acontinuum of care for the patients. We reinterpret and redefine theboundary and function of hospital and community, and thereby create anew service model, the Yuli Model, to help patients to reintegrate intothe community. The Yuli model, which particularly focuses on the needsof people with long-standing illness and prolonged hospital stay,illustrates one approach to linking hospital and community in a creativeand constructive manner."," 10.1186/1752-4458-3-1"," 2009"

A ConfirmatoryFactor Analytic Test"," CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY"," Nowadays, much debate in the bereavement domain is directed towards theinclusion of Complicated Grief (CG) as a separate category in theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Important withinthis discussion is the conceptual relationship between CG reactions andnormal grief (NG) reactions. This study aims at elucidating thisrelationship by using data from 456 bereaved young adults, aged 17 to 25years. We examined the structural distinctiveness of CG and NGreactions, using two criteria sets. The first set ties in with previousresearch in bereaved adults on the distinctiveness of CG and NG andallows to test the replicability of earlier findings. The second setlinks up with the recently revised criteria for CG and permits toinvestigate whether earlier findings hold for the new criteria. For bothsets, two models for NG and CG were compared using confirmatory factoranalytic procedures. These analyses revealed that CG and NG reactionscan be distinguished by their very nature, except for one CG reaction(viz. 'yearning'), that loaded on both factors.

The relation of childhoodpersonality to sexual risk taking during adolescence has been largelyunexplored.METHODS: Using data collected from participants in the Child Sample ofthe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CS-NLSY) when they were 5 or6 years of age (time 1) and 17 or 18 years of age (time 2), the relationof childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence wasinvestigated. Maternal ratings of childhood personality were used toderive resiliency, undercontrol, and overcontrol prototypical profilescores for a diverse sample of 1219 child participants from the CS-NLSY.At time 2, participants reported whether they failed to use oralcontraception or condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Logisticregression models were used to investigate the association ofpersonality to sexual risk taking.RESULTS: Proximity to the overcontrolled personality prototype at time 1was associated with a decreased likelihood of sexual risk taking. Age,male gender, and childhood cognitive achievement were also significantpredictors of sexual risk taking.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that children with personalityprofiles in which internalizing traits are more prominent are lesslikely than their peers to engage in sexual risk taking during lateadolescence. The findings of this study augment previous studies thatindicate that personality is an important predictor of development andunderscore the importance of conducting research into the processes bywhich personality influences health behavior."," 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00351.x"," 2008"

Using Japaneseencephalitis virus (JEV), we now show that a key element in JEV RNAreplication is a complex RNA motif that includes a string of threediscontinuous complementary sequences (TDCS). The TDCS consists of three5-nt-long strands, the left (L) strand upstream of the translationinitiator AUG adjacent to the 5'-end of the genome, and the middle (M)and right (R) strands corresponding to the base of theFlavivirus-conserved 3' stem-loop structure near the 3'-end of the RNA.The three strands are arranged in an antiparallel configuration, withtwo sets of base-pairing interactions creating L-M and M-R duplexes.Disrupting either or both of these duplex regions of TDCS completelyabolished RNA replication, whereas reconstructing both duplex regions,albeit with mutated sequences, fully restored RNA replication. Modelingof replication-competent genomes recovered from a large pool ofpseudorevertants originating from six replication-incompetent TDCSmutants suggests that both duplex base-pairing potentials of TDCS arerequired for RNA replication. in all cases, acquisition of novelsequences within the 3' M-R duplex facilitated a long-range RNA-RNAinteraction of its 3'M strand with either the authentic 51 strand or itsalternative (invariably located upstream of the 5' initiator), therebyrestoring replicability. We also found that a TDCS homolog is conservedin other flaviviruses. These data suggest that two duplex base-pairingsdefined by the TDCS play an essential regulatory role in a key step(s)of Flavivirus RNA replication."," 10.1261/rna.993608"," 2008"

We monitored clinician compliance with eProtocol-insulinrecommendations in four intensive care units in four hospitals andcompared blood glucose distributions with those of a simple clinicalguideline at one hospital and a paper-based protocol at another. Allprotocols and the guideline used intravenous insulin and 80 to 110 mg/dL(4.4-6.1 mmol/L) blood glucose targets.Setting: The setting for this study was four academic hospital intensivecare units.Patients. This study included critically ill adults requiringintravenous insulin.Intervention.

This phenomenon, known as the platelethyperserotonemia of autism, is considered to be one of the mostwell-replicated findings in biological psychiatry. Its replicabilitysuggests that many of the genes involved in autism affect a small numberof biological networks. These networks may also play a role in the earlydevelopment of the autistic brain.Results: We developed an equation that allows calculation of platelet5-HT concentration as a function of measurable biological parameters. Italso provides information about the sensitivity of platelet 5- HT levelsto each of the parameters and their interactions.Conclusion: The model yields platelet 5-HT concentrations that areconsistent with values reported in experimental studies. If theparameters are considered independent, the model predicts that platelet5-HT levels should be sensitive to changes in the platelet 5-HT uptakerate constant, the proportion of free 5-HT cleared in the liver andlungs, the gut 5-HT production rate and its regulation, and the volumeof the gut wall.

In Study 1, we were ableto develop a nine-factor analytic model of conceptions of the desire tobe famous that initially comprised nine separate factors; ambition,meaning derived through comparison with others, psychologicallyvulnerable, attention seeking, conceitedness, social access, altruistic,positive affect, and glamour. Analysis that sought to examinereplicability among these factors suggested that three factors(altruistic, positive affect, and glamour) neither display factorcongruence nor display adequate internal reliability. A second studyexamined the validity of these factors in predicting profiles ofindividuals who may desire fame. The findings from this study suggestedthat two of the nine factors (positive affect and altruism) could not beconsidered strong factors within the model. Overall, the findingssuggest that implicit theories of a desire for fame comprise sixfactors. The discussion focuses on how an implicit model of a desire forfame might progress into formal theories of a desire for fame."," 10.1348/000712607X226935"," 2008"
" J"," Berg, Gregory E."," Pubic bone age estimation in adult women"," JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES"," In recent years, numerous physical anthropologists have pointed out theneed for regional standards for estimating age in various worldpopulations. While investigating aging methods for East Europeanpopulations, dramatic changes were noted in the pubic symphysealmorphology and structure of older adult female individuals. Thesechanges were not captured in the typically used pubic symphysis agingmethods. This paper defines and tests the need for a new phase, phaseVII, that follows the Suchey-Brooks phase VI. In addition, Suchey-Brooksphases V and VI are redefined. Phase definitions, decision-making rules,and comparison graphics for the new method are presented. Balkan (n =85) and Eastern Tennessee (n = 104) samples, totaling 189 individuals,were used in the analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients between fourobservers and a control seriation were strong, indicating ease ofreplicability between investigators. No statistically significantintra-observer error was detected. Summary statistics show thatindividuals in phase V were on average in the early 50s, whileindividuals in phase VI were in their mid 50s to mid 60s, andindividuals in phase VII were in their mid 70s. Since linear regressionmodels tend to under-age the elderly and over-age the young, transitionanalysis, using an unrestricted cumulative probit model, was undertakento evaluate the phases and to produce point estimates for theages-at-transition for the Balkan sample. The highest posterior densityregion point estimates with their associated upper and lower bounds canbe used for predicting age for unknown forensic cases related to theBalkan sample. Further, the mean ages and standard deviations for phasesV-VII for the Tennessee sample are presented for use in Americanforensic cases."," 10.1111/j.1556-4029.2008.00712.x"," 2008"

As is thecase with all novel scientific findings, and especially those that mighthave an impact on clinical practice, replicability is paramount. Thisstudy sought to test this finding for replication and to more accuratelyestimate the effect size of this brief intervention on postoperativemorphine use and postoperative pain and mood ratings.MethodsTwenty participants who underwent gastric bypass surgery completed thisreplication and extension C study. Beck Depression Inventory and Centerfor Epidemiological Studies Depression scale scores were collected beforsurgery and at the time of discharge from the hospital. Immediatelyafter surgery, participants were randomly assigned to receive 20 minutesof real or sham repetitive TMS (rTMS) (10 Hz, 10 seconds-ON, 20seconds-OFF for a total of 4000 Pulses). Patient-controlled morphinepump usage was tracked throughout each participant's postoperativehospital stay. In addition, pain and inood I ratings were collected viaVisual analogue scales twice per day.ResultsFindings from the original postoperative TMS trial were replicated, ascumulative morphine usage curves were significantly steeper amongpatients receiving sham TMS, and participants receiving real TMS hadused 35% less morphine at the time of discharge than participantsreceiving sham TMS. At the time of discharge. subjects who had receivedreal TMS had used 42.50 mg of morphine, whereas subjects receiving shamTMS had used an average of 64.88 mg. When the data from the originalpreliminary trial were combined with the data from this replicationtrial, a significant difference in cumulative morphine usage wasobserved between Subjects receiving real and sham TMS.

In Italian, the TEMPS has previously beenvalidated in its original 32-item version, the TEMPS-I (Pisa), one whichdid not yet include an anxious subscale. Methods: The present sampleconsisted of 948 tionclinical subjects (27.39 years 8.22 S.D.). Therewere 476 men (50.2%: 28.56 years 8.63 S.D.) and 472 women (49.8%: 26.21years +/- 7.61 S.D.). Reliability and validity were assessed by standardpsychometric tests. Results: Principal Components Analysis with Varimaxrotation resulted in a 3-factor solution: the first with highestexplained variance (8.84%) represents Dysthymic, Cyclothymic and Anxious(Dys-Cyc-Anx) temperaments combined; the second identifies Irritabletemperament (5.65% of variance); and the third Hyperthymic temperament(5.16% of variance). Cronbach Alpha coefficients for the three subscaleswere respectively.89,.77 and.74. The rates for the Dys-Cyc-Anx were2.7%, and for the Irritable 3.1%. Despite the low rate of theHyperthymic temperament (.2%), nonetheless 16% were between Ist and 2ndSD. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a positive loading combiningDys-Cyc-Anx with the Irritable; the Hyperthymic loaded negatively onthis factor. In terms of dominant temperaments, based on z-scores, 2.7%were dysthymic, 1.7% cyclothymic,.7% hyperthymic, 3.5% irritable and 3%anxious. Limitation: Although developed for self-rated use, the Italianauthors nonetheless administered the TEMPS-A in an interview format.

Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value asplaying a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an'objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis.We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective andinadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. Acommon theme throughout many of these reasons is that p valuesexaggerate the evidence against H(0). This, in turn, calls into questionthe validity of much published work based on comparatively small,including.05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed aboutthe limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, thisinferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity.Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics,effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle forreliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would alsohave agreed with the need for replication research."," 10.1177/0959354307086923"," 2008"

A review of literature onparticipant description in aphasia research indicates a clear need forimprovement in the description of and control for visual acuity, colourperception, visual fields, visual attention, and ocular motor functions.Few authors control for or describe even basic aspects of vision.Aims: Strategic design of visual screening protocols is advocated.Appropriate selection of screening methods depends on specificassessment and experimental tasks to be administered in a given study.Researchers are encouraged to implement, and to describe in publishedreports, specific procedures to address visual acuity, colourperception, visual fields, visual attention, and ocular motor functions.Main Contribution: Visual characteristics are presented within aframework of (1) those that may be evaluated as part of a case historyand (2) those that may be directly screened by experimenters or assessedby collaborating professionals. Recommended screening procedures, andtheir relevance to various assessment and experimental tasks, aredescribed to assist researchers in strategically designing visualassessment protocols for future studies involving individuals withaphasia and related disorders.Conclusions: Improved assessment of visual function will improve thevalidity, quality, and replicability of research as well as readers'interpretations of published data and authors' conclusions. Formativefeedback concerning appropriate participant control and description iscritical for improving the peer review process for research publicationand funding. As training in visual assessment is not central to thetraining of most researchers in neurogenic communication disorders,further focus on this important issue within graduate programmes andcontinuing education curricula is needed."," 10.1080/02687030701429113"," 2008"

There wasno restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language.Wound healing was the primary endpoint.Data collection and analysisData from eligible trials were extracted and summarised using a dataextraction sheet by one author and independently verified by a secondauthor.Main results19 trials ( n = 2554) were identified that met the inclusion criteria.In acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in acutelacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and nine trialsevaluated the effect the honey in burns. In chronic wounds two trialsevaluated the effect of honey in venous leg ulcers and one trial inpressure ulcers, infected post- operative wounds, and Fournier'sgangrene respectively. Two trials recruited people with mixed groups ofchronic or acute wounds. The poor quality of most of the trial reportsmeans the results should be interpreted with caution, except in venousleg ulcers. In acute wounds, honey may reduce time to healing comparedwith some conventional dressings in partial thickness burns ( WMD - 4.68days, 95% CI - 4.28 to - 5.09 days). All the included burns trials haveoriginated from a single centre, which may have impact on replicability.In chronic wounds, honey in addition to compression bandaging does notsignificantly increase healing in venous leg ulcers ( RR 1.15, 95% CI0.96 to 1.38). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect ofhoney compared with other treatments for burns or in other acute orchronic wound types.Authors' conclusionsHoney may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial andpartial thickness burns compared with some conventional dressings.

Moreover, domestic private equity funds will be complementaryto foreign private equity funds, not a substitute, at least for the timebeing. In arguing so, we will look into the investment experiences offoreign private equity funds and see how foreign private equity fundshave helped transform the economy in the post-financial crisis era. Wewill also look at the domestic private equity funds market to examinethe replicability of private equity-driven growth in Korea. The paperwill conclude with further recommendations for the growth of the privateequity market. In the past five years or so, Koreans have come to befamiliar with names such as Carlyle, Newbridge Capital, Lone Star, etc.These are the names of major foreign institutional investment firms thatbought out the Korean domestic banks, Koram Bank, Korea First Bank, andKorea Exchange Bank. Recently, with the incident of the Lone Starscandal disclosed in regards to its acquisition of Korea First Bank, theKorean media have given extensive coverage to the issues relating toprivate equity funds. Especially after the scandals involving foreigninvestors, there is public discontent about the large volume of foreignprivate equity funds, mainly in the financial sector, that seem to 'eatand run' once increased profits have been made. People have scrutinizedinvestments of this kind with critical eyes.  Nevertheless, we shouldacknowledge the contributions that the foreign private equity funds haveplayed in various sectors of the economy in the post-crisis period.Foreign funds have invested in troubled Korean firms, understanding anyrisks involved, and successfully turned them around for the better. Tothat end, even if domestic private equity funds that have been set upsince 2004 have not yet performed to the market expectation, we have tounderstand that they have further roles to play as we anticipate growthof the M&A market in the coming years.",NA," 2008"

The contaminated oysters were thenplaced in clean aquariums for 20 days to allow them to depurate andrecover. The lysosomal destabilization was linearly correlated with thePAH body burdens. Regression analysis showed that critical body residue(CBR), in terms of lysosomal destabilization (at least 50% ofdestabilized cells), was found at 2,100 ng/g (9.32 nmol/g) of totalPAHs. This CBR is much lower than the CBRs for reproduction and death,confirming that lysosomal destabilization, as a cellular levelbiomarker, appears to be functioning as an early warning indicator thatcan be used to detect aquatic contamination much before severe effectsare observed. During 25 days of exposure, the lysosomal destabilizationand PAH body burdens increased from 32 to 75% and 77 to 5,925 ng/g,respectively. After 20 days of elimination period, the lysosomaldestabilization and PAH body burdens decreased to 49% and 2,350 ng/g,respectively. Uptake rates of PAHs showed parabolic shaped correlationwith hydrophobicity (K-ow). Uptake rate constants of more hydrophobicPAHs (log K-ow > 4.6) had a negative correlation with K-ow, implyingthat hydrophobicity alone is not a satisfactory predictor for thesePAHs.

Methods Three hundred and forty-five seniorkindergarten children (191 boys and 154 girls) coming from threekindergartens in Jintan were selected to participate in the study.Intelligence was measured by intelligence quotient (IQ) using the WPPSI.Results The mean scores of children IQ in three kindergartens were(101.80 +/- 11.88). There were no gender differences in fullintelligence quotient (FIQ) (P>0.05), and verbal intelligence quotient(VIQ) in both male and female children: were significantly lower thantheir Performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) (P<0.01). The percent ofIQ disassociation was 28.70% in the children, with 69.70% of thechildren had VIQ lower than PIQ, the IQ disassociation children did notdiffer from other children in terms of FIQ ((P>0.05).

Outof a GWAS, we randomly grab handfuls of SNPs, modeling their effects ina multiple linear (or logistic) regression. The model's significance isused to obtain an iteratively updated pseudo-Bayesian posteriorprobability associated with each SNP, which is repeated over many randomdraws until the distribution becomes stable. A stepwise procedure cullsthe list of SNPs to define the final set. Results from a benchmarksimulation of 5 quantitative trait genes among 1,000, in 1,000 randomsubjects, are contrasted with marginal tests using nominal significance,Bonferroni-corrected significance, false discovery rates, as well aswith serial selection methods. Random handfuls produced the bestcombination of sensitivity (0.95) specificity (0.99) and true positiverate (0.71) of all methods tested and better replicability in anindependent subject set.

However, the SPARC model has not been tested incommunities elsewhere. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention facilitated a partnership between SPARC and the AgingServices division of the Atlanta Regional Commission to evaluate theprogram's replicability.METHODS: SPARC coalitions involving local public health agencies,hospitals, social service organizations, and advocacy groups wereestablished in two counties of the region, with the Atlanta RegionalCommission providing regional coordination. Using the SPARC model, thecoalitions planned, marketed, and implemented community-based activitiesto deliver adult screenings and vaccinations.CONSEQUENCES: During a 3-week pilot phase, SPARC clinics were held incentral Atlanta at three senior housing facilities, a local firestation, and a charter middle school, delivering 353 prevention servicesto 314 residents. In Fayette County, 634 people received influenzavaccinations on Election Day at SPARC clinics located near 10 pollingplaces.INTERPRETATION: The SPARC model provides a practical framework forimproving the community-wide delivery of disease prevention services.The model can galvanize local health services providers to developsuccessful locally tailored interventions, and the approach isapplicable in communities outside of SPARC's home region.",NA," 2008"
" J"," Jingxiong ZhangJinping ZhangNa Yao"," Uncertainty characterization in spatial categorical information"," Proceedings of the SPIE - The International Society for OpticalEngineering"," Uncertainty is an integral component in thematic mapping, anddescriptors such as percent correctly classified pixels (PCC) and Kappacoefficients of agreement have been devised as thematic accuracymetrics. However, such spatially averaged measures neither offer hintsabout spatial variation in accuracy, nor are they useful for errorpropagation in derivatives due to the deficiency that spatial dependencyis not properly accommodated. Geostatistics provides a good frameworkfor spatial uncertainty characterization, as conditional simulation isdesigned for generating equal-probable realizations of often sparselysampled fields of concern, which can be summarized for error statisticsor subjected to particular geo-processing to facilitate errorpropagation. Often, for modeling errors in area-class maps depictingdistributions of spatial classes, stochastic indicator simulation isemployed. Unfortunately, indicator approaches suffer from non-invariantbehaviors in simulated classes as class labels are drawn from intervalsof class probabilities that are arbitrarily ordered. Discriminantspace-based models have been proposed to enhance consistency in mappingspatial classes and replicability in modeling spatial categoricaluncertainty. This paper explores bivariate (rather than univariate)discriminant models and extends uncertainty modeling from single-time tobi-temporal area-class maps. Experiment using simulated data sets wascarried out to quantify errors in area classes and their propagation inchange analysis. It was found that there are significant differencesbetween the results obtained by discriminant models and those byindicator geostatistics. Further investigations are anticipatedincorporating real data for mapping and propagating errors in areaclasses."," 10.1117/12.815656"," 2008"

We sought evidence on: analytic performance oftests, clinical validity (i.e., prognostic accuracy and discrimination),clinical utility (i.e., prediction of treatment benefit), harms, impacton clinical decision making and health care costs.RESULTS: Few papers were found on the analytic validity of the OncotypeDX and MammaPrint tests, but these showed reasonable within-laboratoryreplicability. Pre-analytic issues related to sample storage andpreparation may play a larger role than within-laboratory variation. Forclinical validity, studies differed according to whether they examinedthe actual test that is currently being offered to patients or theunderlying gene signature. Almost all of the Oncotype DX evidence wasfor the marketed test, the strongest validation study being from one armof a randomized controlled trial (NSABP-14) with a clinicallyhomogeneous population. This study showed that the test, added in aclinically meaningful manner to standard prognostic indices. TheMammaPrint signature and test itself was examined in studies withclinically heterogeneous populations (e.g., mix of ER positivity andtamoxifen treatment) and showed a clinically relevant separation ofpatients into risk categories, but it was not clear exactly how manypredictions would be shifted across decision thresholds if this wereused in combination with traditional indices. The BCP test itself wasexamined in one study, and the signature was tested in a variety offormulations in several studies. One randomized controlled trialprovided high quality retrospective evidence of the clinical utility ofOncotype DX to predict chemotherapy treatment benefit, but evidence forclinical utility was not found for MammaPrint or the H/I ratio. Threedecision analyses examined the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer geneexpression assays, and overall were inconclusive.CONCLUSIONS: Oncotype DX is furthest along the validation pathway, withstrong retrospective evidence that it predicts distant spread andchemotherapy benefit to a clinically relevant extent over standardpredictors, in a well-defined clinical subgroup with clear treatmentimplications. The evidence for clinical implications of using MammaPrintwas not as clear as with Oncotype DX, and the ability to predictchemotherapy benefit does not yet exist. The H/I ratio test requiresfurther validation.

Therefore, the G4 ligand RHPS4 maypossess antitumor activity. Here, we show that RHPS4 triggers a rapidand potent DNA damage response at telomeres in human transformedfibroblasts and melanoma cells, characterized by the formation ofseveral telomeric foci containing phosphorylated DNA damage responsefactors gamma-H2AX, RAD17, and 53BP1. This was dependent on DNA repairenzyme ATR, correlated with delocalization of the protective telomericDNA-binding protein POT1, and was antagonized by overexpression of POT1or TRF2. In mice, RHPS4 exerted its antitumor effect on xenografts ofhuman tumor cells of different histotype by telomere injury and tumorcell apoptosis. Tumor inhibition was accompanied by a strong DNA damageresponse, and tumors overexpressing POT1 or TRF2 were resistant to RHPS4treatment.

Many havenoticed an apparent paradox of age-related increase in activation ofstructures that undergo the greatest structural deterioration. P. M.Greenwood (2007) proposes a theoretical framework for explaining thatparadox by postulating plastic compensatory remodeling in the agingbrain. This is a worthy first step, although several problems informulating a testable set of hypotheses remain to be addressed. Theworking definition of plasticity that is driving this theory needs to beclarified. The biological basis, strength, and replicability ofstructure-function relationships derived from neuroimaging, on whichGreenwood relies in her theorizing, remain to be established. Theextrapolation of plasticity phenomena observed in acute lesions togradual aging process needs to be justified. All in all, this is apositive development in the field that may be ripe for theoreticalgeneralizations."," 10.1037/0894-4105.21.6.676"," 2007"

The results of these studieshave shown a remarkable, statistically significant heterogeneity, withsome studies indicating the T-allele as a risk factor, others theC-allele, and others finding no association. Recent studies in whichexposure to house-dust endotoxin or to domestic sources of microbialexposure were assessed concomitantly with CD14/-159 have shown aconsistent, replicable gene-environment interaction. Specifically,results suggest that the C-allele is a risk factor for allergicphenotypes at low levels of exposure, whereas the T-allele is a riskfactor at high levels of exposure. This finding seems to be explained bya genetically-determined heterogeneity for the protective effect ofmicrobial exposure on allergic phenotypes, with homozygotes for theC-allele showing a much stronger negative association between exposureand allergic outcomes than carries of the other two genotypes. Theseresults suggest that the often encountered, limited replicability ofgenetic associations may, at least in part, be due to complexinteractions between genes and environment in determining asthma-relatedoutcomes."," 10.1513/pats.200702-035AW"," 2007"

Conventionally, lineage-specificdifferentiation of hESCs is achieved through supplementation of variouscytokines and chemical factors within the culture milieu. Nevertheless,this is a highly inefficient approach that is often limited by poorreplicability. An alternative is through genetic modulation withrecombinant DNA. Hence, this study investigated whether transduction ofhESCs with an adenoviral vector expressing the human VEGF(165) gene(Ad-hVEGF(165)) can enhance endothelial-lineage differentiation. ThehESCs were induced to form embryoid bodies (EBs) by culturing themwithin low-attachment plates for 7 days, and were subsequentlytrypsinized into single cells, prior to transduction with Ad-hVEGF165.Optimal transduction efficiency with high cell viability was achieved by4-h exposure of the differentiating hESCs to viral particles at a ratioof I : 500 for three consecutive days. ELISA results showed thatAd-hVEGF(165)-transduced cells secreted human vascular endothelialgrowth factor (hVEGF) for more than 30 days post-transduction, peakingon day 8, and the conditioned medium from the transduced cellsstimulated extensive proliferation of HUVEC. Real-time PCR analysisshowed positive upregulation of VEGF, Ang-1, Flt-1, Tie-2, CD34, CD31,CD133 and Flk-1 gene expression in Ad-hVEGF165-transduced cells.Additionally, flow cytometric analysis of CD133 cell surface markerrevealed an approximately 5-fold increase in CD133 marker expression inAd-hVEGF165-transduced cells compared to the non-transduced control.Hence, this study demonstrated that transduction of differentiatinghESCs with Ad-hVEGF165 facilitated expression of the VEGF transgene,which in turn significantly enhanced endothelial differentiation ofhESCs.

To validate a method for the presumptive diagnosis ofcutaneous leishmaniasis based on the observation ofclinical-epidemiological criteria, carried out by community healthworkers in three endemic municipalities in Santander, a department innortheastern Colombia.Methods. This evaluation study of diagnostic technologies was based on across-sectional sampling of suspected cases of cutaneous leishmaniasisin the municipalities of Rionegro, El Playon, and Landazuri. After beingtrained, the community health workers carried out the presumptivediagnoses of cutaneous leishmaniasis between October 2004 and November2005. At the time of diagnosis, the health workers also collectedsamples for confirmatory diagnosis through Field's stain method,culturing, and polymerase chain reaction. Four criteria were used toassess the validity of the presumptive diagnoses carried out by thehealth workers: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, andnegative predictive value. Replicability among the health workers wasestimated through their observed level of agreement.Results. According to the laboratory tests, of the 196 patients studied,33 (16.8%) were negative and 163 (83.2%) were positive. For all thelevels of certainty of the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity wasbetween 52% and 98% (kappa(1, 0) = 39.0%) and the specificity between 9%and 55% (kappa(0, 0) = 14.0%). The area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve was 56.5% (95% confidence interval: 45.6% to67.4%). The proportion of positive agreement and of negative agreementwas 86.3% and 43.5%, respectively.Conclusions. The sensitivity of the presumptive diagnosis carried out bythe health workers surpasses that of the parasitological diagnosticmethods generally used in the three endemic areas, but its specificityis much lower. Even though this approach is not useful as a diagnostictest for cutaneous leishmaniasis or as a criterion for deciding toproceed with treatment or not., the method is useful for the activeidentification of cases in the community."," 10.1590/S1020-49892007000500001"," 2007"

In particular, an array ofdemonstrable consciousness-related anomalous physical phenomena, apersistent pattern of biological and medical anomalies, systematicstudies of mind/brain relationships and the mechanics of humancreativity, and a burgeoning catalogue of human factors effects withincontemporary information processing 'technologies, all display empiricalcorrelations with subjective aspects that greatly complicate, and inmany cases preclude, their comprehension on strictly objective grounds.However, any disciplined re-admission of subjective elements ' intorigorous scientific methodology will hinge on the precision with whichthey can be defined, measured, and represented; and on the resilience ofestablished scientific techniques to their inclusion. For example, anyneo-subjective science, while retaining the logical rigor,empirical/theoretical dialogue, and cultural purpose of its rigidlyobjective predecessor, would have the following requirements:acknowledgment of a proactive role for human consciousness; moreexplicit and profound use of interdisciplinary metaphors; more generousinterpretations of measurability, replicability, and resonance; areduction of ontological aspirations; and an overarching teleologicalcausality. Most importantly, the subjective and objective aspects ofthis holistic science would have to stand in mutually respectful andconstructive complementarity to one another if the composite disciplinewere to fulfill itself and its role in society."," 10.1016/j.explore.2007.03.014"," 2007"

Our goal was to determine if multiple courses of antenatalbetamethasone affect auditory neural maturation in 28 to 32 weeks'gestational age infants.PATIENTS AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was performed tocompare auditory neural maturation between premature infants exposed to1 course of betamethasone and infants exposed to >= 2 courses ofbetamethasone. Inclusion criteria included all 28 to 32 weeks'gestational age infants delivered between July 1996 and December 1998who had auditory brainstem response testing performed ( 80- dB clickstimuli at a repetition rate of 39.9/ second) within 24 hours ofpostnatal life as part of bilirubin- auditory studies. Infants withtoxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes infections, chromosomaldisorders, unstable conditions, exposure to antenatal dexamethasone, andexposure to < 1 complete course of betamethasone were excluded. Auditorywaveforms were categorized into response types on response replicabilityand peak identification as types 1 through 4 ( type 1 indicating mostmature). Absolute and interpeak wave latencies were measured whenapplicable. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed by usingthe chi(2) test and Student's t test, respectively.RESULTS. Of 174 infants studied, 123 received antenatal steroids. Ofthese, 50 received 1 course and 29 received >= 2 courses ofbetamethasone. There were no significant differences in perinataldemographics between the 2 groups. After controlling for confoundingvariables, there was no significant difference in mean absolute wavelatencies, mean interpeak latencies, or distribution of response typebetween the 2 groups. There also was no significant difference in anyauditory brainstem response parameters between infants exposed to 1course of betamethasone ( n = 50) and infants exposed to > 2 courses ofbetamethasone ( n = 17).CONCLUSION. Compared with a single recommended course of antenatalsteroids, multiple courses of antenatal betamethasone are not associatedwith a deleterious effect on auditory neural maturation in 28 to 32weeks' gestational age infants."," 10.1542/peds.2006-2174"," 2007"

As an effective method inclassifying industry substructure, the stock return method has beenproposed in the field using the spot movements of stock returns uponinside and outside perturbations. In the paper, we apply the method to asample in the airline, banking and oil industries over the period from1988 to 1992 in order to examine whether the groups found are reasonablefrom a common sense point of view and whether their structures arerobust across different sample windows. We find that the groupsidentified show a clear face validity and that the group structures areconsistently maintained across 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 5‐year windows. Theresults may imply that the method could detect both industry andstrategic group effects at the same time. Given that objectivity andreplicability are crucial in empirical studies, the stock return methodis likely to introduce a way to enhance the level of empirical work inthe strategic group research.",NA," 2007"

A sample of 236 volunteer Kuwaiti personnel took part inthe study. The mean ages of men and women were 41.5 (SD = 7.5) and 40.9(SD = 7.1), respectively. The alpha reliability of the ASDA was found tobe high (.93). Women had a significantly higher mean total score on theASDA as well as on 17 out of its 20 items. Middle-aged personnel had asignificantly lower mean ASDA total score than younger college students(M age = 22). The factor analysis of the ASDA items yielded threefactors: fear of dead people and tombs; fear of postmortem events; andfear of lethal disease. These factors were highly replicable withprevious factors extracted from a Kuwaiti college student sample. On thebasis of the present findings, there are three general conclusions asfollows: death anxiety is negatively associated with age; thesex-related differences on death anxiety are salient in the Arabsamples; and the ASDA has a highly replicable factor structure."," 10.2190/OM.55.4.d"," 2007"

In injectionmolding, the mold is normally cooled in order to shorten the formingcycle time. However, higher mold temperature is preferable during theresin filling period from the viewpoint of resin flowability. In thisstudy, the mold temperature was controlled so that the core is heatedduring the resin filling period followed by cooling until the plasticpart is ejected from the mold. The sheet metal laminated mold enablesthis heating and cooling cycle because channels for hot and cool watercan be circulated uniformly adjacent to the mold surface. Thistemperature control using the sheet metal laminated mold has suchadvantages as high-cycle forming, improved flowability of resin,superior replicability, and high accuracy of the injection molded parts.",NA," 2007"

While simple univariate caseswith  b=1 (b being the dimension of the discriminant space) wereinvestigated previously using simulated data, real world applicationsare usually multivariate with  b>1, thus giving rises to the need fordeveloping discriminant models in spaces of higher dimensionality forincreased applicability. This paper describes combined use ofgeneralized linear modeling and kriging for area-class mapping, with theformer deterministically predicting mean class responses while thelatter making use of spatially correlated residuals in the predictiveclass models. Scalability in area-class mapping is facilitated byflexible implementation of scale-dependent prediction of mean classresponses and point- vs. area-support kriging of the residuals. This isfollowed by an empirical study concerning land cover mapping in centralwestern Montana, which confirmed the effectiveness of the proposedstrategy combining regression and kriging for scale-dependent mapping ofarea classes.

Their present form, version3.1 published in 2001, demands a quantitative assessment of speciesstatus, and has been carefully designed to accommodate the spectrum ofcase-studies from large mammals to mosses or commercially-exploitedtrees to poorly-known insects. Consequently, the categories are assignedby the use of any one of five major criteria that infer either past orpotential species population declines, or habitat declines, restrictionin geographical distribution or population numbers. For the uninitiatedassessors of forest species, the categories may present a daunting needfor largely unavailable data. In this paper, we would like todemonstrate that the categories can be applied through the use ofavailable forest management data, biological inventory datasets and/orproxy information on habitats, as well as a certain amount of inferenceor extrapolation.

Consumer relevance and demands on servicesystems and practices are influencing how mental health care isdelivered and how, systems will be shaped in the future.Aims of the Study: The present report seeks to assemble a confluence ofconsumer-driven themes from noteworthy reports on the state of themental health system in the U.S. It also explores innovative efforts,promising practices, collaborative efforts, as well as identification ofbarriers to consumer-directed care, with possible solutions.Method: The report reviews the relevant public mental health policy anddata used in published work.Results: The findings indicate an increasing public and private interestin promoting consumer-driven care, even though historical systems ofcare predominate, and often create, barriers to widespread redesign of aconsumer-c entered mental health care system. Innovative consumer-drivenpractices are increasing as quality, choice, and self-determinationbecome integral parts of a redesigned U.S. mental health care system.Discussion and Limitations: The use of consumer-driven approaches inmental health is limited at best. These programs challenge industrynorms and traditional practices. Limitations include the need foradditional and thorough evaluations of effectiveness (cost and clinical)and replicability of consumer-directed programs.Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Consumer-driven servicesindicate that mental health consumers are expecting to be moreparticipative in their mental health care. This expectation willinfluence how traditional mental health services and providers becomemore consumer-centric and meet the demand.Implications for Health Policies: Public and private interest inconsumer-driven health care range from creating cost-conscious consumersto individualized control of recovery. The health care sector shouldseek to invest more resources in the provision of consumer-driven healthcare programs.

None of these has reached a sufficient level of confidence tobe accepted as a universal susceptibility gene and problems ofreplicability suggest that many may be false positives. Nevertheless,these genes can be grouped into distinct families related to glutamatetransmission (in particular related to NMDA receptor function), thecontrol of synaptic plasticity, dopaminergic transmission, oxidativestress, glutathione and quinone metabolism and oligodendrocyteviability. These families mirror the processes disrupted in theschizophrenic brain and certain gene families can be linked together toform a clearly defined signalling cascade involved in the phenomenon ofNMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity,that may be interconnected with oligodendrocyte and oxidativestress-related pathways. Many of the protein products of these genesinteract with each other, forming complex integrated networks. Certainhigh-interest genes (for example DISC1, NRG1, COMT) may exert multipleeffects on different areas of these pathways, while others exert morespecific effects on certain branches. The convergence of a large numberof genes on a definable signaling network raises the possibility ofnumerous interactions between gene candidates, and suggests that atargeted multigenic pathway approach would be useful in gene associationstudies.

Resultsindicated that the predictive power of both approaches was remarkablyrobust between age 17 and 22, and even increased in the case ofaggressiveness. At age 22 the long-term predictive ability of both typesand dimensions was about equal, both in terms of the multivariatepercentage of explained variance and the number of significantlongitudinal correlates. This pattern is consistent with the notion thatpersonality types and variables represent core personality domains thatpredict a wide range of longitudinal outcomes. However, the predictiveability of both approaches was larger for personality traits andintelligence than for social relationships outcomes.

The massive multiple-testing issues involved inanalyzing these data make the correct level of confidence to place inmRNA abundance quantitative trait loci (QTL) a difficult problem. We usea unique resource to directly test mRNA abundance QTL replicability inmice: paired recombinant inbred (RI) and F-2 data sets derived fromC57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains and phenotyped using thesame Affymetrix arrays.

We describe QTL replication at varying stringencies in these data.For instance, 78% of mRNA expression QTL (eQTL) with genome-wideadjusted p <= 0.0001 in RI data replicate at a genome-wide adjusted p <0.05 or better. Replicated QTL are disproportionately putativelycis-acting, and approximately 75% have higher apparent expression levelsassociated with B6 genotypes, which may be partly due to probe setgeneration using B6 sequence. Finally, we note that while trans-actingQTL do not replicate well between data sets in general, at least onecluster of trans-acting QTL on distal Chr 1 is notably preserved betweendata sets."," 10.1007/s00335-005-0187-8"," 2006"

Using the example of two overlappingsediment cores from the North Norfolk coast, UK, the advantages andlimitations of the transfer function methodology are examined. While theselected cores are taken from different sites, and display contrastingpatterns of sedimentation, the foraminiferal transfer function distilscomparable records of relative sea-level change from both sequences.These reconstructions are consistent with existing sea-level indexpoints from the region but produce a more detailed record of relativesea-level change. Transfer functions can extract sea-level informationfrom a wider range of sedimentary sub-environments. This increases theamount of data that can be collected from coastal deposits and improvesrecord resolution. The replicability of the transfer functionmethodology, coupled with the sequential nature of the data it produces,assists in the compilation and analysis of sea-level records fromdifferent sites. This technique has the potential to bridge the gapbetween short-term (instrumental) and long-term (geological orgeophysical) records of sea-level change."," 10.1098/rsta.2006.1749"," 2006"

During the 1980s, the UN launched the bottom-up approach,which emphasizes the involvement of community-based organizations inshelter projects. This approach promotes enabling strategies in aneffort to overcome obstacles encountered under the top-down approach:namely displacement, affordability, cost-recovery, and replicability.This paper explores what LDCs are doing to implement the bottom-upapproach, and this is accomplished by examining the cases of Nairobi,Kenya, and Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic. The study analyzes howthe governments of both countries have responded to the policiespromoted under the two approaches. Data on government policies areanalyzed to find out whether the governments of Kenya and the DominicanRepublic have provided an enabling environment for other actors. Thisstudy reveals that both governments have adopted enabling policies intheir National Action Plans which include: facilitating the efforts ofall actors in providing shelter; the use of non-conventional buildingmaterials; and the upgrading of low-income housing. This research showsthat the bottom-up approach is more likely to be successful inovercoming factors that inhibit the provision of low-income housing ascompared to the top-down approach.

The importance of a shift toward agricultural systems,which are more complex in terms of biodiversity in emerging countriessuch as China, where most of the population (about 70%) lives in ruralareas, in poor conditions and still relies on agriculture as the mainsource of income is discussed. In China the risk of shifting to moreintensive and polluting agricultural production patterns to address thedemand for food of the growing population and the need of higher incomesof rural communities is relatively high. With the present Chineseeconomic growth, urbanization and increased leisure time, tourism andrecreation activities in rural areas are also increasing. Additionally,in the restructuring process of economy in rural areas, one of the mostobvious effects is the necessity to create job opportunities alternativeto agricultural sector. The role of sustainable agriculture forenvironment protection in a country such as China is highlighted. Theattention paid to activities in the agro-environmental sector has beenincreasing over the years in this country due to the high social andeconomic priority attached by the Chinese authorities to themodernization of agriculture that must be pursued in a sustainablemanner, addressing at once food security, environment protection,economic development and good management of natural resources.

" J"," Kokkonen, AEsala, MAura, E"," Acceleration of N mineralization by release of enzymes and substratesfrom soil mineral particles with phosphates"," SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY"," A study was conducted to develop an improved method for measuringorganic N (net) mineralization in which chemical extraction takes placein combination with suspension incubation in ammonia-absorbing membranebottles. To obtain direct evidence of the extent to which extractedorganic N is mineralizable, the extraction suspension was furtherincubated immediately after the extraction procedure with mild andselective extractants. In this 'extraction incubation' method,extraction continues during the incubation but only relatively easilymineralizable organic matter is released. Standard incubation is usuallycarried out in sealed N-2-flushed bottles. However, when phosphate orpyrophosphate soil suspensions are incubated, mineralization is muchhigher than in soil water suspensions. Further, accumulation of ammonia+ (ammonium) and other gases, i.e. CO2, can affect the reaction rate andfinal reaction equilibrium in the sealed incubation flask. It was toavoid these effects that the membrane method was developed. With thisprocedure, the flask is closed with an ammonia-absorbing membranepermeable to other gases. Water, phosphate and pyrophosphate suspensionswere incubated at 37 degrees C in sealed bottles (SB), in sealed N-2gas-flushed bottles (SBN2), and in bottles with ammonia-trapping filters(MB). The maximum amount of NH4+ - N released during 10 days' incubationwas 133.0 mg kg(-1) in the water, 208.0 mg kg(-1) in the phosphate and454.1 mg kg(-1) in the pyrophosphate suspension (soil total C content6.2% and N 0.25%). During incubation in phosphate and pyrophosphatesuspensions, the mobilization was nearly linear in membrane bottles. Thevariation between replicates was also smallest in these bottles. It wasconcluded that membrane bottles were best suited to incubation whenmobilization reactions were accelerated with phosphate or pyrophosphateextractants.

The variability in performance of the market can beexplained by problems both related to and independent of the allocationsystem. The most important problems independent of the water allocationmechanism are those arising as a result of unavoidable transactioncosts, externalities due to inadequate definition of use rights in theWater Code, and uncertainty regarding the availability of water.Likewise, certain problems related to the allocation system have beenidentified, viz., the lack of adequate and timely information; thedifference between nominal and in rem (latin term used to describejurisdiction over property without regard to personal jurisdiction)rights; conflicts arising between users due to the sale of traditionalrights; unavoidable transaction costs; and the hoarding ofnon-consumptive rights. In summary, the water use rights marketrepresents a useful allocation mechanism for water resources. However,it is necessary to reformulate the regulatory framework of thismechanism so as to reduce the existence of conditioning factors thathave limited the efficiency, sustainability, and replicability of thisallocation mechanism.",NA," 2006"

In 1998, a review of severalof the ELF EMF human biological interaction mechanisms regarding fieldintensities and frequencies was presented to the Australian RadiationLaboratory of Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Healthin 1988 by Andrew W. Wood. Wood's 1988 assertion of the importance ofunderstanding the interaction mechanisms did not alter even after adecade when the NIEHS RAPID (http://ww-w.niehs.nih.gov/) gathering ofworld experts produced their statement, in which quoted, there have beenexperiments on possible mechanism/s in support or refutation of thevarious proposals however none were replicated. Valberg (Valberg et al.,1997) also summed up some but failed to include all the claimed proposedmechanisms at the time.This paper is to present a complete list of the allegedly possibleinteraction mechanisms to date. This paper will also report on anacademic research on computer modeling of biological effects of ELF EMFusing one of the proposed mechanisms. The research reported here hasgenerally aimed at modeling the proposals using computer. The initialphase of this effort has concentrated on Ca effect as the number ofpublications referencing that was considerable. Calcium is a key elementin the biological performance of every organ in the human body. Thus itdeemed imperative to study the effect of EMF on Ca channels of a livingcell.Furthermore, considerations for setting standards in EMF experimentalresearch protocols are recommended. Developing a standard protocolallows results of future experiments to be comparable; and, the chanceof replicability in EMF-health improve, which this aspect hasindisputably been absent in EMF research projects thus far. Replicationis desirable mainly because it eliminates bias, artifact and systematicerrors. Replication is almost impossible in the case of epidemiologicalstudies however in experimentation is possible if the details arespecified in full.

Forexample, the calculation of summary measures of population health (SMPH)can be compromised if co-morbidity is not taken into account. Onepopular co-morbidity adjustment used in SMPH computations relies on astraightforward multiplicative combination of the severity weights forthe individual conditions involved. While the convenience and simplicityof the multiplicative model are attractive, its appropriateness has yetto be formally tested. The primary objective of the current study wastherefore to examine the empirical evidence in support of this approach.METHODS: The present study drew on information on the prevalence ofchronic conditions and a utility-based measure of health-related qualityof life (HRQoL), namely the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3),available from Cycle 1.1 of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS;2000-01). Average HUI3 scores were computed for both single andco-morbid conditions, and were also purified by statistically removingthe loss of functional health due to health problems other than thechronic conditions reported. The co-morbidity rule was specified as amultiplicative combination of the purified average observed HUI3 utilityscores for the individual conditions involved, with the addition of asynergy coefficient s for capturing any interaction between theconditions not explained by the product of their utilities. The fit ofthe model to the purified average observed utilities for the co-morbidconditions was optimized using ordinary least squares regression toestimate s. Replicability of the results was assessed by applying themethod to triple co-morbidities from the CCHS cycle 1.1 database, aswell as to double and triple co-morbidities from cycle 2.1 of the CCHS(2003-04).RESULTS: Model fit was optimized at s = .99 (i.e., essentially astraightforward multiplicative model). These results were closelyreplicated with triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2000-01, as wellas with double and triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2003-04.CONCLUSION: The findings support the simple multiplicative model forcomputing utilities for co-morbid conditions from the utilities for theindividual conditions involved. Future work using a wider variety ofconditions and data sources could serve to further evaluate and refinethe approach."," 10.1186/1478-7954-4-13"," 2006"

How cana good plan or policy be identified? What is the process of implementinga transport plan or policy? In doing this the paper has the ambitiousobjective of proposing a new model and process for transport planningand policy. It is applicable in developed and developing countries andis not restricted to the transport sector. The paper builds on, and is areinterpretation of two cornerstone transport planning anddecision-making models - the CATS (Chicago Area Transportation Study)Planning and Design Model and Braybrooke and Lindblom's DisjointedIncrementalism. It advances a technique of experiential incrementalism(termed polisanalysis) to develop and implement plans and policies. Itproposes that problems should be diagnosed by observation and continuousdata collection; that their continuous analysis, finding the ""cure"", andimplementation take place through the method of experientialincrementalism. In this method interventions are grounded on thetheories of neoinstitutional economics and psychoanalysis and derivedusing contact function, explained in the paper, which renders the methodscientific replicability. Experiential incrementalism can employ a widerarray of options in planning and policy than is presently thoughtpossible.

In Chesapeake Baysamples, average VP rates were 10-fold higher for FLV and DIL (similarto 3 to 25 x 10(10) viruses l(-1) d(-1)) than for TdR (similar to 0.2 to3 x 10(10) viruses l(-1) d(-1)). Estimates of viral-mediated bacterialmortality (VMM) indicate that FLV overestimates VP in eutrophic waters,since > 100 % of bacterial production (BP) would have been consumedthrough viral lysis. DIL and TdR VP methods gave more realisticestimates of VMM with respect to BP. The FLV method provides estimatesof both VP and virus removal rates; however, it requires preparation ofa viral tracer and twice as many microscopic enumerations as the DILmethod. DIL was the least difficult and most efficient method; however,bacterial loss during vacuum diafiltration resulted in poorreplicability. TdR gave similar VP estimates to DIL, but requires use ofa large and poorly constrained conversion factor. With methodologicalimprovements in bacterial cell recovery, DIL should be the most widelyapplicable method for estimation of VP in highly productive estuarinewaters."," 10.3354/ame041209"," 2005"

In thisstudy, software for the exploration of exploration (SEE) was used tosearch a large database for a novel behavioral measure that wouldcharacterize complex movement paths. The database included mouseopen-field behavior assessed in 3 laboratories, 7 inbred strains,several pharmacological treatments and hundreds of animals. The newbehavioral measure, 'path texture', was characterized using the localcurvature of the path (the change of direction per unit distance, indegrees/cm) across several spatial scales, starting from scales smallerthan the animal's body length and up to the scale of the arena size.Path texture analysis differs from fractal dimension analysis in that itdoes not assume self-similarity across scales. Path texture was found todiscriminate inbred strains with relatively high broad-senseheritability (43%-71%) and high replicability across laboratories. Evengenotypes that had similar path curvatures in some scales usuallydiffered in other scales, and self-similarity across scales was notdisplayed by all genotypes. Amphetamine decreased the path curvature ofC57BL/6 mice in small and medium scales, while having no effect onDBA/2J mice. Diazepam close-dependently decreased the curvature ofC57BL/6 mice across all scales, while 2 anxiogenic drugs, FG-7142 andpentylenetetrazole, increased it.

Our numerical approach is based on suitablemodels for the different effects considered. We compared modelpredictions with experimental results obtained in our laboratory in thewhole phase parameter space, for acoustic pressures from the bubbledissolution limit up to bubble extinction. The effects were taken intoaccount simultaneously to consider the transition fromnonsonoluminescence to sonoluminescence bubbles. The model includes (1)inside the bubble, transient and spatially nonuniform heat transferusing a collocation points method, dissociation of O-2 and N-2, and massdiffusion of vapor in the noncondensable gases; (2) at the bubbleinterface, nonequilibrium evaporation and condensation of water and atemperature jump due to the accommodation coefficient; (3) in theliquid, transient and spatially nonuniform heat transfer using acollocation points method, and mass diffusion of the gas in the liquid.The model is completed with a Rayleigh-Plesset equation with liquidcompressible terms and vapor mass transfer. We computed the boundary forthe shape instability based on the temporal evolution of the computedradius. The model is valid for an arbitrary number of dissociable gasesdissolved in the liquid. We also obtained absolute measurements for R(t)using two photodetectors and Mie scattering calculations. The robusttechnique used allows the estimation of experimental results of absoluteR-0 and P-a. The technique is based on identifying the bubbledissolution limit coincident with the parametric instability in(P-a,R-0) parameter space. We take advantage of the fact that this pointcan be determined experimentally with high precision and replicability.We computed the equilibrium concentration of the different gaseousspecies and water vapor during collapse as a function of P-a and R-0.The model obtains from first principles the result that insonoluminescence the bubble is practically 100% argon for air dissolvedin water. Therefore, the dissociation reactions in air bubbles must betaken into account for quantitative computations of maximumtemperatures. The agreement found between the numerical and experimentaldata is very good in the whole parameter space explored. We do not fitany parameter in the model. We believe that we capture all the relevantphysics with the model."," 10.1103/PhysRevE.72.046305"," 2005"

In this study, the authorsasked 335 graduate students attending the Northwestern student healthclinic on the Chicago campus to complete a written survey anonymously. Atotal of 305 (91%) patients completed the survey. The sensitivity andspecificity for the SCOFF was 53.3% and 93.2%, respectively. Thisproduced a PPV (the proportion who tested positive on the screen andactually had an eating disorder) of 66.7% and an NPV (the proportion ofthose who tested negative on the screen and actually did not have aneating disorder) of 88.7%. More than 80% of respondents weredissatisfied with their shape and weight, with over one third having amoderate to severe body image disturbance. The SCOFF is an easyinstrument to administer that health care providers can use to screenfor eating disorders in the primary care setting."," 10.3200/JACH.54.2.103-107"," 2005"

" J"," Garge, NRPage, GPSprague, APGorman, BSAllison, DB"," Reproducible clusters from microarray research: Whither?"," BMC BIOINFORMATICS"," Motivation: In cluster analysis, the validity of specific solutions,algorithms, and procedures present significant challenges because thereis no null hypothesis to test and no 'right answer'. It has been notedthat a replicable classification is not necessarily a useful one, but auseful one that characterizes some aspect of the population must bereplicable. By replicable we mean reproducible across multiple samplingsfrom the same population. Methodologists have suggested that thevalidity of clustering methods should be based on classifications thatyield reproducible findings beyond chance levels. We used this approachto determine the performance of commonly used clustering algorithms andthe degree of replicability achieved using several microarray datasets.Methods: We considered four commonly used iterative partitioningalgorithms ( Self Organizing Maps (SOM), K-means, Clutsering LARgeApplications (CLARA), and Fuzzy C-means) and evaluated theirperformances on 37 microarray datasets, with sample sizes ranging from12 to 172. We assessed reproducibility of the clustering algorithm bymeasuring the strength of relationship between clustering outputs ofsubsamples of 37 datasets. Cluster stability was quantified usingCramer's v(2) from a kXk table. Cramer's v(2) is equivalent to thesquared canonical correlation coefficient between two sets of nominalvariables. Potential scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting perfectreproducibility.Results: All four clustering routines show increased stability withlarger sample sizes. K-means and SOM showed a gradual increase instability with increasing sample size. CLARA and Fuzzy C-means, however,yielded low stability scores until sample sizes approached 30 and thengradually increased thereafter. Average stability never exceeded 0.55for the four clustering routines, even at a sample size of 50. Thesefindings suggest several plausible scenarios: ( 1) microarray datasetslack natural clustering structure thereby producing low stability scoreson all four methods; ( 2) the algorithms studied do not produce reliableresults and/or ( 3) sample sizes typically used in microarray researchmay be too small to support derivation of reliable clustering results.Further research should be directed towards evaluating stabilityperformances of more clustering algorithms on more datasets speciallyhaving larger sample sizes with larger numbers of clusters considered."," 10.1186/1471-2105-6-S2-S10"," 2005"

A laboratory stress testthat can be repeated would be helpful in testing the efficacy ofinterventions in decreasing the response to stress before more extensivetrials are begun. The effects of two types of psychological stresstests, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a stress imagery test, onpsychological, physiological, and hormonal responses (salivary cortisoland DHEA) were examined when each test was given twice to cocaine- ormethamphetamine-dependent human subjects, 24 of whom completed at leastone session. The stress imagery test produced significant changes inseveral of the subjective response measures in both first and secondsessions, including several measures of negative affect and a cravingmeasure. The TSST produced significant changes only in the secondsession. The stress imagery protocol showed better replicability acrosstwo sessions. Cocaine users and methamphetamine users did not respondsimilarly in their craving responses. Reported craving formethamphetamine after stress testing showed decreases or much smallerincreases compared to that for cocaine. Neither stress testsignificantly increased salivary cortisol or DHEA, and changes inhormone concentrations were not related to subjective responses. Theseresults suggest that stress imagery testing procedures may be useful asprovocative tests of stress-induced affect and stimulant drug craving.Although less convincing because of the heterogeneity of the subjects,they also suggest that HPA axis responsivity is not clearly linked toacute stress-induced stimulant craving or affective response.

Numerous studies have used molecular datato elucidate settlement patterns in the Indo-Pacific region, but thesame evidence is often interpreted in opposing ways by differentresearchers. Above all, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity has beenused to discriminate between competing migration models and has narrowedthe probable source of proto-Polynesian peoples to southern China andTaiwan or eastern Indonesia. Richards et al. (1998) used a dating methodemploying the p statistic to argue for an origin of Polynesian peoplesin eastern Indonesia during the Pleistocene (> 10,000 years ago). Here,the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) is recalculated fora new series of Indonesian mtDNA sequences with Polynesian affinities.These data, which incorporate additional sequences published after 1998,produce dates that cannot rule out the possibility of a common ancestorfor these sequences during the Holocene (< 10,000 years ago). Thisimplies that previous estimates of TMRCA dates for Indonesian sequenceslacked the statistical robustness necessary for replicability. Theextant mtDNA evidence can no longer be viewed as favoring a Polynesianorigin in eastern Indonesia, but instead remains consistent with anorigin of proto-Polynesian peoples in southern China and Taiwan."," 10.1353/hub.2005.0037"," 2005"

A recent multilaboratory experiment foundsignificant laboratory effects and genotype x laboratory interactionseven after rigorous standardization, raising the concern that resultsare idiosyncratic to a particular laboratory.

The questionnaire is a self-report 110-item measure thatpostulates five affective temperaments-the depressive, cyclothymic,irritable, hyperthymic, and anxious-which embody both strengths andliabilities along affective lines. Methods: The questionnaire wasadministered to 658 clinically-well subjects in a Turkish universitycircle. We undertook item analysis and test-retest reliability. We thenexamined internal consistency through factor analysis with PCA rotation.Results: We found good to excellent test-retest reliability (0.73-0.91),and internal consistency (0.77-0.85). We deleted 10 items with factorloading < 0.20 for their own subscales, resulting in a questionnairewith 99 items. Despite considerable overlap between depressive andcognitive anxiety traits, a distinct ""nervous""-anxious factor emerged aswell, and the hypothesized (original English) 5-factor structure of theTEMPS-A was supported. Cut-offs for each temperament were based onz-scores higher than +2S.D. Dominant irritable (3.7%). nervous-anxious(3.7%) and depressive (3.1%) temperaments were the most common in thispopulation, whereas dominant cyclothymic (1.7%) and hyperthymic (1.2%)temperaments were relatively uncommon. These temperaments tended to losetheir intensity with age. As expected, women scored significantly higheron the nervous-anxious, and men on the hyperthymic temperaments.Limitations: The sample was composed of younger subjects with highereducation than the General population of Turkey. Although thedistribution of the scores for each of the temperaments deviatedsomewhat from normal Curves, for heuristic reasons we did attempt toprovide prevalence rates based on z-scores. Conclusion: In thispreliminary version of the TEMPS-A, we have retained 100 (of theoriginal 110) traits loading > 0.20. Some deleted items referred tosleep, others appeared socially desirability traits in the Turkishculture endorsed by many subjects. Nonetheless, item analyses withineach factor revealed traits indicative of personal assets (specific toeach temperament) along with those which might represent vulnerabilityto affective illness.

" J"," Garner, JP"," Stereotypies and other abnormal repetitive behaviors: Potential impacton validity, reliability, and replicability of scientific outcomes"," ILAR JOURNAL"," Normal behavior plays a key role in facilitating homeostasis, especiallyby allowing the animal to control and modify its environment. Captiveenvironments may interfere with these behavioral responses, and theresulting stress may alter many physiological parameters. Abnormalbehaviors indicate that an animal is unable to adjust behaviorally tothe captive environment and, hence, may be expressing abnormalphysiology. Therefore, captive environments may affect the followingaspects of an experiment: validity, by introducing abnormal animals intoexperiments; reliability, by increasing interindividual variationthrough the introduction of such individuals; and replicability, byaltering the number and type of such individuals between laboratories.Thus, far from increasing variability, enrichment may actually improvevalidity, reliability, and replicability by reducing the number ofabnormal animals introduced into experiments. In this article, thespecific example of abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs) is explored.ARBs in captive animals appear to involve the same mechanisms as ARBs inhuman psychiatry, which reflect underlying abnormalities of brainfunction. ARBs are also correlated with a wide range of behavioralchanges that affect experimental outcomes. Thus, ARBs in laboratoryanimals may compromise validity, reliability, and replicability,especially in behavioral experiments; and enrichments that prevent ARBmay enhance validity, reliability, and replicability. Although manylinks in this argument have been tested experimentally, key issues stillremain in the interpretation of these data. In particular, it iscurrently unclear (1) whether or not the differences in brain functionseen in animals performing ARB are abnormal, (2) which common behavioralparadigms are affected by ARB, and (3) whether enrichment does indeedimprove the quality of behavioral data. Ongoing and future workaddressing these issues is outlined.",NA," 2005"

However, geochemical processes andporewater solute distributions in sandy beds are not well studied withvery few exceptions. An experiment was carried out to determinedifferences in nutrient fluxes between coarse and fine-grained sedimentand water column in aquatic laboratory microcosms.Four 80-litre aquaria, containing seawater and ten sediment cores (8-cmdiameter) each were monitored for 60 days. Coarse and fine-grainedsediment, collected from two different coastal areas of Mytilini, islandof Lesvos, were sieved to avoid macrofaunal bioturbation andhomogenized. Two aquaria were used as replications for each treatment inorder to validate the replicability of the experiment. Informationrelated to chemical and biological parameters was collected from thewater column, the interstitial water and the sediment (in 12-daysinterval). Net fluxes of oxygen and inorganic nutrients were measured byclosing the sediment cores with a rubber stopper. The optimum incubationtime was estimated to be 10 hours in a previous experiment. Watersamples were collected just before closing the cores and after theincubation, in triplicates.The replicability of results within the microcosms of the same treatmentwas excellent in general and differences in trends of fluxes werepresented for specific nutrients. Experimental data showed remarkablereplicability in terms of temporal variability in both treatments. Inmost cases data had the same behaviour with only minor differences inthe magnitude of values i.e. ammonium, silicate and nitrite. However,the nutrient fluxes between sediment and water column depictedsignificant individual fluctuations.The nutrient concentration changes in ""blank"" cores were low in bothtreatments with few exceptions.

Urban DevelopmentProgrammes are usually developed in a complex interplay betweendifferent governmental levels, and implemented by a wide variety ofpublic and non-public parties. This paper addresses the organisation ofthese programmes, concentrating in particular on the form and extent of`public-public partnership', i.e. on the role that the different levelsof the public administration play, both through the administrativesystem and through policy-making. The `empirical' basis for the paperconsists of case studies, derived from the UGIS project (`UrbanGovernance, Social Inclusion and Sustainability,' a research projectfinanced by the European Commission, DG RTD). The short analysis makesclear that both the model of public administration, in terms of theextent and form of decentralisation, and the presence (or lack) of anational policy framework determine the extent to which UDPs can beplanned, approved and implemented at the local level. One of the mainfindings is that the central influence over UDPs depends more on theurban policy framework of the central government than on the model ofpublic administration of a country. Countries with strong national(regional) urban policies, sufficient decentralisation of publicadministration to the municipal level and the use of governance methodsat the local level open up possibilities for successful UDPs. Withoutupper-level urban policy frameworks UDPs might be successful as well,but their replicability and the control over their external effects willnot be ensured."," 10.1111/j.1467-9663.2005.00471.x"," 2005"

There is evidencefrom family, twin and adoption studies that the contribution of geneticfactors accounts for 40-60% of alcohol dependence. In humans, the mainapproaches for investigating the complex genetics of alcoholism arelinkage and association studies. Linkage studies reported alcoholism tobe linked to only 5 chromosomal regions (on chromosomes 1, 7, andpossibly 2, 4 and 5) and none of those loci reached a high statisticalsignificance. Association studies are conducted by numerous researchgroups. They test a potential relationship between a certain geneticvariant and alcoholism in a design similar to the classical case-controlstudies. Polymorphisms in the GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, andglutamatergic system have been related to alcohol- or alcoholism-associated phenotypes. Many studies failed to confirm initialpositive results, raising doubts on the validity and replicability ofthis study approach. Recently more research has been conducted usinggenetic microarrays to investigate expression patterns of genes underthe influence of chronic alcohol consumption. However, these approacheshave several shortcomings, in particular their applicability in humans.In short, approaches in use for years by many research groups such aslinkage and association studies showed either controversial ordisappointing results. New approaches using endophenotypes and geneticmicroarrays may be helpful to shed light more light on the complexgenetic background of alcoholism."," 10.2174/1389202043348733"," 2004"

Soil lipids, mostlyoriginating from plants and microorganisms, have traditionally beenanalysed by non-automated extraction and separation methods, whichproduce several lipid fractions, operationally defined by polarity. Herewe present a combination of fast, automated and reproducible techniques,adopted from organic geochemical studies, for preparative separation ofindividual soil lipid fractions with increasing polarity. Thesetechniques involve commercially available instruments, includingaccelerated solvent extraction and a two-step automated medium-pressureliquid chromatography procedure. The method yields eight lipid fractionsconsisting of five fractions fully amenable to gas chromatography/massspectrometry (GC/MS) (aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons,ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids), and three fractions of highlypolar or high molecular weight compounds (bases, very long-chain waxesters (C40(+)), high polarity compounds) that were not measurable withGC/MS under standard conditions. We tested the method on fiveagricultural soils. Results show that (i) mass recoveries for theindividual fractions are reproducible, (ii) within individual fractionscompound distribution patterns are reproducible, as demonstrated foralkanes and carboxylic acids, and (iii) individual fractions representdistinct and clean compound classes, free of interfering substancesdetectable by GC/MS. Thus, automated separation can be a fast, effectiveand reproducible procedure for fractionation of complex mixtures of soillipids into clean compound classes, directly suitable for a variety ofmolecular (e.g. GC/MS) and isotopic characterizations (e.g. gaschromatography coupled with isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometryor accelerator mass spectrometry)."," 10.1111/j.1351-0754.2004.00601.x"," 2004"

The need for increasingly precisereconstructions of relative sea-level change has, in-turn, driven thedevelopment of new methodologies capable of resolving fine-scalevariability within salt-marsh sedimentary sequences. The use ofsalt-marsh foraminifera, as precise indicators of past tide levels hasplayed a central role in this process and is exemplified by a number ofdetailed studies conducted in Connecticut, USA. In this paper, we applythe most recent methodological advance in the reconstruction of relativesea-levels using salt-marsh foraminifera. We develop a foraminiferaltransfer function for tide level, derived from the modem foraminiferaldistributions of four Connecticut salt-marshes.In contrast to existing approaches that employ site-specificinterpolations of local vertical foraminiferal assemblage zones, thistransfer function can provide objective, quantitative and reproducibleestimates of palacomarsh-surface elevation with explicitly stated errorterms for marshes throughout Connecticut, irrespective of differences intidal range.We demonstrate the foraminiferal transfer function approach by employingit to reconstruct changes in palaeomarsh-surface elevation from threecores recovered from Hammock River marsh, Connecticut. The resultingreconstructions, which are precise to +/- 0.09 m, are tested using anindependent dataset from the neighbouring state of Maine, and are usedto assess a pivotal record of mean high water (MHW) change from thissite. We conclude that the transfer function reconstructions show goodgeneral agreement with previous records of palaeomarsh-surfaceelevation, but with the advantages of quantified error terms and atransparent, reproducible methodology. This replicability will assist inthe comparison or combination of local records of MHW change to inferlarge-scale, regional sea-level variations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Questionnaires differentiated reflection and rumination:reflection correlated with openness to experience, whereas ruminationcorrelated with neuroticism, replicating previous findings that it isspecifically ruminative self-focus that is maladaptive. Memory measuresalso differentiated reflection and rumination: reflection was unrelatedto the affective qualities of memories, whereas rumination correlatedwith measures of the happiness, unhappiness and at-oneness of memories.Dispositional ruminative self-focus, like neuroticism, was specificallyrelated to increased accessibility of memories of events whereindividuals felt ""not at all at-one with things"".

Numerous studies have employed the Delphi technique to seekexpert opinion about aspects of clinical practice. When researchingliterature on the Delphi technique, however, we discovered discrepanciesin its application, and a lack of detail when reporting design,administration, and analysis methods. Such lack of specificity hindersthe replicability and assessment of the clinical and cultural validityand reliability of Delphi studies.Aim. The aim of this paper is to detail the practical application of theDelphi technique as a culturally and clinically valid means of accessingexpert opinion on the importance of clinical criteria.Methods. Reference is made to a bicultural New Zealand mental healthnursing clinical indicator study that employed a three-round reactiveDelphi survey. Equal proportions of Maori and non-Maori nurses (n = 20)and consumers (n = 10) rated the importance of 91 clinical indicatorstatements for the achievement of professional practice standards.Additional statements (n = 21) suggested by Delphi participants in round1 were included in subsequent rounds. In round 2, participants explainedthe rating they applied to statements that had not reached consensus inround 1, and summarized responses were provided to participants in round3. Consensus was considered to have been achieved if 85% of round 3ratings lay within a 2-point bracket on the 5-point Likert-scaleoverall, or in one of the Maori nurse, non-Maori nurse, or consumergroups. A mean rating of 4.5 after round 3 was set as the importancethreshold.Findings. Consensus occurred overall on 75 statements, and within groupson another 24.

Everyone, including the analytic investigator,however, has a science, in the sense of a world-view that is replicatedby experience. Jung offered hermeneutics as an alternative mode toscience for getting to know the psychological subject. But as Heideggeremphasized, hermeneutics always begins with the projection of aworld-view, i.e., the science of the would-be interpreter. In theanalytic situation, dialogue is available to test the world-view andenlarge its horizon, in accord with Gadamer's expansion of hermeneutics,'the classical discipline concerned with the art of understandingtexts', into a method of inquiry open to the possibilities of otherness.An example is given from an analytic training seminar, in which theauthor began by projecting his version of the theory of psychologicaltypes onto the dream material a candidate offered in response to theseminar. A dialogue with the candidate ensued which enabled the teacherto correct his original, somewhat rigid, application of his scientificviewpoint. In such a dialogue, psyche emerges as the final interpreterof what is, generating hypotheses that can fruitfully be applied to theunderstanding of other cases."," 10.1111/j.1465-5922.2003.00452.x"," 2004"

Six resulting clusters were labeled Disengaged, Immotive,Relapse Risk, Early Action, Maintainers, and Habituated. A series ofanalyses tested the internal and external validity of the typology. Theinternal validity test revealed that four of the clusters demonstratedhigh stability and replicability, while the Relapse Risk and EarlyAction clusters were less stable. Differences among clusters onself-reported exercise behavior and a strong association with stage ofchange for regular exercise provided external validity evidence of thetypology.Conclusions. The resulting typology reflects a range of motivationalpatterns that are likely to be responsive to different types of messagesand strategies regarding adoption and maintenance of regular exercise.The typology also generates a number of hypotheses about the identifiedclusters that can be empirically tested in further studies.

Method: The TAS-20 was administeredto 1933 adults (880 men and 1053 women) residing in several small citiesand towns in Ontario, Canada. The factor structure of the scale wasassessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CIA). Results: Thethree-factor structure of the TAS-20 was replicable in the entirecommunity sample and also separately in men and women. The TAS-20 andits three factors demonstrated internal reliability, and the variablesof gender, age, and education accounted for relatively small or modestamounts of variability in total TAS-20 and factor scale scores.Conclusion: The results provide strong support for the reliability andfactorial validity of the TAS-20 and indicate the importance of usingCFA when assessing the replicability and theoretical integrity of thefactor structure of the scale.

In addition, 490 patients visiting their generalpractitioner completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in thefirst phase of a longitudinal study evaluating service delivery to ruralTasmania. Three different methods for scoring the GHQ-12 were utilizedand each resultant data set was analysed using a Confirmatory FactorAnalysis (CFA) to establish which of the various factor models providedthe most consistent description of the data.Result: None of the complete factor models that have been proposed havebeen consistently replicated across studies.

All of the models had adequate fit to theTasmanian data when the usual scoring was used. However, only one modelhad a consistently high 'goodness of fit' across scoring methods.Conclusion: It was concluded that the 'best fit' was achieved by a modelbased on an early factor analytic study using an Australian sample.

Fourteen healthy adult volunteers (7 males and 7 females), withan average age of 26.61 +/- 4.20 years and no history of extractions,temporomandibular joint dysfunction, or orthodontic treatment, wereselected for the study. Accurate casts were mounted on an articulator(Denar D4A) by means of a facebow and maximum intercuspation siliconeregistration record. A mechanical 3-dimensional mandibular positionindicator was constructed and mounted on the articulator enabling theoperator to analyze the mandibular positions in 3 spatial axes (x,anteroposterior; y, superoinferior; z, mediolateral shift). Each centricrelation method was recorded four times on each subject (at baseline, 1hour, 1 day, and 1 week at approximately the same time of day). Recordswere transferred to the articulator, and data were extracted using astereomicroscope modified to accept the mandibular position indicator.RESULTS: Variability within subjects ranged from 0.03 mm (left-side zaxis for the bimanual method) to 1.6 mm (left-side y axis for the Gothicarch method). To indicate the least variable (most repeatable) method acomparison was made using the F test. The bimanual method was the mostconsistent, showing between 10.11 (p = 1) and 0.438 (p = 0.005) timesless variation than the Gothic arch method (the least consistent).

Whereas the basic tenet of MMN isappealing, several issues-of-contention remain to be solved before thisevent related potential (ERP) can be applicable for routine clinicaluse. These issues include the consistent identification of MMN withinindividuals (vs. groups), its stability over time, and its reportedlypoor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Results:Stepwise weighted multiple regression led to a significant model. The1999-to-1995 electoral gains/losses of two opposition parties, togetherwith the population variation caused by migration balance and bybirths/deaths balance, accounted for a substantial part (30%) of thevariability in preceding district-level suicide rates.

When the amount of data issmall the same data needs to be used repeatedly in order to get areasonable estimate of the accuracy of the learning algorithms. Thisresults in violations of assumptions on which standard tests are basedand makes it hard to design a good test.In this article, we investigate sign tests to address the problem ofchoosing the best of two learning algorithms when only a small data setis available.

Currentmethods for estimating viral production (VP) rely on one or more poorlyconstrained conversion factors. Here, three incubation-based VP methods;fluorescently labeled viruses (FLV), dilution (DIL) and thymidineincorporation (TdR), were evaluated in water samples from the Delaware(DB) and Chesapeake (CB) Bays. In the FLV method the changing ratio ofan added fluorescently labeled viral tracer to total viruses is used toestimate production of new viruses. The dilution approach utilizesvirus-free water to dilute viral abundance to ca. 10% of originalconcentration in experimental incubations. Viral production is inferredfrom the slope of the regression line for changes in viral abundanceover time. The TdR method measures VP through incorporation of3H-thymidine into the viral fraction. VP rates were variable accordingto each method. For station 858 CB, average VP rates were higher for FLVand TdR (16.9X1010 vir/L/d), (17.2X1010 vir/L/d) respectively, than forDIL (4.50X109 vir/L/d). Mean estimates of virioplankton turnover variedbetween methods and locations: CB (FLV 1.85d, DIL 0.68d, TdR 1.64d); DB(FLV 1.65d, DIL 0.19d). Using a burst size of 50 to estimateviral-mediated bacterial mortality indicates that FLV overestimates VPin eutrophic water samples as greater than 100% of bacterial productionwould be consumed through viral lysis. DIL and TdR VP estimates yieldedmore realistic estimates of viral-mediated mortiality with respect tobacterial production. The FLV method had the advantage of providing bothVP and virus removal data. However, FLV requires preparation of alabeled viral concentrate and more microscopic enumerations than DIL.Among the methods DIL was the least difficult and most efficient methodhowever, 80% of bacteria were removed during vacuum filtration resultingin poor replicability. The TdR approach gave similar VP estimates toDIL, but requires use of a large and poorly constrained conversionfactor.",NA," 2003"

In addition, overlap ofclassification systems was examined to determine whether the fourtypologies may be narrowed to a smaller set of meaningful, non-redundantsubtype schemas.Design Baseline data from five treatment outcome studies were used tofacilitate subtyping according to four alcohol typologies: antisocial(ASP) versus non-ASP, early versus late onset, Type 1/Type 2 and TypeA/Type B.Setting The studies were conducted at several in-patient and out-patienttreatment sites.Participants The sample included 342 participants (23% female) who metDSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. MeasurementsSubjects were assessed on substance use severity, family history,psychopathology, personality and psychosocial functioning.Findings Type 1/Type 2 and Type A/B typologies were replicated. Type1/Type 2 had poor construct validity due to symptom cluster overlapbetween the two subgroups. Only 14% of the subjects met criteria for ASPThe two strongest associations including that between early versus lateonset and Type 1/Type 2 and that between ASP versus non-ASP and TypeA/Type 13, were expected and reflect overlaps in conceptual definitions.In comparison, the relationship between early versus late onset and ASPversus non-ASP and Type A/B was weak.Conclusions Clinical utility of the ASP/non-ASP typology is limited innon-Veterans Administration (VA) samples, due to low prevalence. TheType 1/Type 2 subtyping schema was redundant with the age of onsetschema, and was the least internally valid of all four typologies. Ingeneral, the Type A/B schema was most promising of prevailing typologicsstudied. It was relatively inclusive, and the A, B groups were distinctfrom one another. However, dichotomous typologies may not be complexenough to be clinically useful descriptors of alcoholic samples.

Three hundred and forty-seven undergraduate studentscompleted the scales along with measures of trait negative affect (TNA)and trait positive affect (TPA), task- and emotion-oriented coping andperceived stress. All scale had adequate internal consistency and therewas strong evidence of convergent validity. Regarding factor structurereplicability the LOT was marginally superior. The Possibility of thescales' redundancy because of contamination by TNA or TPA depended onthe criterion construct. It is argued that the LOT and HS are the scalesof choice when assessing hope and/or optimism."," 10.1177/00164402062003005"," 2002"
" J"," Browder, JO"," Conservation and development projects in the Brazilian Amazon: Lessonsfrom the community initiative program in Rondonia"," ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT"," Community-based conservation and development has become the prevailingprogrammatic paradigm of conservation organizations and developmentdonors over the last 20 years, spawning a myriad of integratedconservation and development projects (ICDP) around the world. Appealingfor its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economicdevelopment at the local level with the conservation of legallyestablished protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDPapproach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists forfailing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Developmentplanners and economists have also raised questions about the financialsustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the modelfrom highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper brieflyreviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservationand development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, Adescription of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot programof the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in thewestern Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is asignificant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply theprinciples of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous differentcommunities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author'smid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservationimpacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has notsignificantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia asintended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation inmunicipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIPprojects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed,approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to localcommunities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the finalsection. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the finalsection, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: theimportance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need forexplicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficientinstitutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequateattention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lackof technical criteria for measuring project sustainability."," 10.1007/s00267-001-2613-3"," 2002"

" J"," Costa, PTHerbst, JHMcCrae, RRSamuels, JOzer, DJ"," The replicability and utility of three personality types"," EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY"," Personality types are construed as constellations of features thatuniquely define discrete groups of individuals. Types are conceptuallyconvenient because they summarize many traits in a single label, butuntil recently most researchers agreed that there was little evidencefor the existence of discrete personality types. Several groups ofresearchers have now proposed replicable, empirical person clustersbased on measures of the Five-Factor Model. We consider severalmethodological artifacts that might be responsible for these types, andconclude that these artifacts may contribute to the replicability oftypes, but cannot entirely account for it. The present research attemptsto replicate these types in four large and diverse adult samples: theBaltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 1856); the East BaltimoreEpidemiologic Catchment Area study (N = 486); the University of NorthCarolina Alumni Heart Study (N = 2 420); and an HIV risk reductionintervention study (N = 274). A clear replication (kappa = 0.60) of theproposed types vas found in only one sample by one standard ofcomparison. The failure of the three personality types to replicate inthree of the four samples leads to the conclusion that they are notrobust empirical entities. Type membership predicted psychosocialfunctioning and ego resiliency and control, but only because itsummarized trait standing; dimensional trait measures were consistentlybetter predictors. Nevertheless, while the types do not refer todistinct, homogeneous classes of persons, they do have utility asconvenient labels summarizing combinations of traits that relate toimportant outcomes.

(2001)described three personality types derived from Q-factor analysis ofQ-sorts or cluster analysis of multiple trait ratings. The types werelabelled as resilients, undercontrollers, and overcontrollers and theywere described in terms of averaged Five-Factor Model (FFM) scores. Thepresent study aimed to investigate the consistency and replicability ofthese prototypes across different FFM measures (i.e. HiPIC and NEO PI-R)and ages (children and adolescents). In addition, the stability ofprototype classification across a 3 year interval was examined. Thetypes described by Caspi and Asendorpf and colleagues were onlypartially replicable and consistent across ages starting from HiPICratings, but not for NEO-PI-R ratings. Prototype classification was notstable across a 3 year interval. It is concluded that clusterreplicabilitly, consistency, and stability depend on samplecharacteristics and the multiple trait measures, although thesedifficulties do not necessarily limit the usefulness of the types forapplied purposes.

One common characteristic of thesesystems is that they require the recording of thousands of separateholograms, whether as local pages or individually placed bits, in orderto fill the memory to capacity. While such configurations are suitablefor write-once read-many (WORM) or rewritable memories, they are notpractical as a distributable read-only memory (ROM) format, whichrequires fast replicability for mass production. A typical page-orientedsystem using a megabit-sized array would require the recording ofhundreds of thousands of holograms to reach capacities of 100 GB ormore. Even with millisecond-order hologram exposure times, taking intoaccount the added time required for changing positions, recording onememory to full capacity would likely require tens of minutes, if nothours. In this paper we propose a novel holographic ROM architecture inwhich the time required to produce a 100 GB-order capacity disc may bereduced to under a minute, and potentially to the order of seconds."," 10.1109/OMODS.2002.1028595"," 2002"

Lowinterpretability of micro/mesocosm studies, and inconclusive and highlyvariable data, resulted in a discontinuation of the use of these studiesfor the registration of pesticides. Coefficients of variation, CV%, werecalculated on the basis of data tables as a measure of statistical'effectiveness' taken from the literature. The average CV in theinvestigated studies was 45%; larger out-door mesocosms averaged 51%,and smaller indoor micro/mesocosms averaged 32%. CVs on variablesinvolving animals were higher than CVs on plant end-points, which inturn were higher than abiotic variables for all experiments. However, toenhance the interpretability and implementation of micro/mesocosmstudies for pesticide registration, a number of context-dependent stepscould be incorporated; 1) determine the appropriate experimental designand number of replicates by using power analysis, 2) Utilise advancedstatistical analysis, such as probabilistic effect distribution andprincipal response curves, 4) report, preferably in quantitative termsusing power analysis, the risk of Type II error. The author's primaryconclusion is that the level of CVs is context dependent and, therefore,it is not possible to suggest a generally acceptable level of CVs forall experiments. This has been suggested both directly and indirectly inthe literature. Moreover, the number of insignificant (p > 0.05) resultsis high, 88% of all test biotic variables had no statisticalsignificance. The average number of replicates were 3-4, whichtheoretically should yield significant effects at least at the highesttest-concentration, then resulting in 75-66% insignificant results."," 10.1065/espr2001.09.085"," 2002"

First, we dispute Saucier's new interpretationof the Negative Valence factor as a meaningful dimension of personalityvariation. We explain that Negative Valence terms may distort thestructure of personality-descriptive terms, and that the substantivevariance of Honesty is weakly correlated with Negative Valence. Also, wepoint out that our proposed six factors are (like the Big Five) roughlyorthogonal, and that the occurrence of rotational variants within thissix-dimensional space is not problematic. We argue that in terms ofcomprehensiveness, parsimony, independence of factors, and replicabilityacross languages, our proposed six-factor model so far seems to be theoptimal structure of personality characteristics.

At the sametime, technological progress and institutional innovations made possiblewide private sector participation, ranging from management contractsthrough concessions to full-fledged privatization of energy, Water andsanitation utilities and state-owned public transport companies.During this time, the financial markets also evolved in conducivedirections by developing new and innovative financing instruments thatmade possible the tapping of new sources of financing-insurance, pensionfunds and a variety of other institutional investors. The emergence ofnew forms of credit guarantees, the availability of instruments tofinance private and municipal projects without sovereign guarantees, andthe proliferation of new modalities for private-public sectorpartnerships opened up opportunities for resource mobilization and risksharing which were not available to most developing countries a decadeago.While these innovative financing mechanisms have accessed new,previously inaccessible sources of funds for sector investments and, incombination with a more realistic pricing of services, have enhanced thefinancial sustainability of sectors such as power, water, sanitation,and transport, they have not necessarily enhanced environmentalsustainability. Furthermore, despite the obvious similarities in theinnovative financing instruments in these four sectors, there are alsosignificant differences arising from both different sectoral featuresand historical reasons.This paper explores innovative instruments for sector financing,focusing particularly on energy, transport, water, sanitation, andforestry.

The standard stimulus (P = 0.79) was a tone pairseparated by a 120 ms silent inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and thedeviant stimuli were tone pairs with an ISI of 100, 60, and 20 ms (P =0.07 for each).Results: The 20 and 60 ms ISI deviant tone pairs elicited a significantMMN during both recording sessions and they were also behaviorallydiscriminated, whereas neither did the 100 ins ISI deviant pair elicitsignificant MMN nor was it behaviorally discriminated. Furthermore,there was a significant correlation between the MMN and reaction timesto the 20 and 60 ins ISI deviant pairs. The 20 ins ISI deviant stimuluselicited highly replicable MMNs (r = 0.75), whereas the less welldiscriminated 60 ms ISI deviant pair did not (r = 0.60).Conclusions: The MMN reflects discrimination accuracy of temporal soundintervals, Furthermore, when the physical difference between thestandard and deviant tone pair in the temporal domain is large, it iselicited with high reliability.

The authors analyzed 3 models specifying patterns ofrelationship between social support and depression (main effect.mediation effect, and moderation effect) separately within data setsusing hierarchical ordinary least squares regression. Results werecompared across data sets.Results. The replication analysis confirmed the robustness of behaviorproblems and caregiver health as important contributors to caregiverdistress, Results of hypotheses examining the pattern of relationshipbetween social support and distress were inconsistent, however.

Any solar-induced climatic change needs tobe distinguished from other causes of natural climate variability andfrom short-term catastrophic events induced either by external orinternal processes. Such events might themselves generate a periodicity,or in combination with other forcing factors they may contribute towardsa periodicity (and so spuriously imply a universal and continuingperiodicity in the climate record), or they may resonate with asolar-induced periodicity. Here, evidence from peat records forperiodicity in climate change over the mid to late Holocene is reviewedand this is followed by a test of the replicability of claimedperiodicities using blanket peat data covering the past 2000 yr fromfour sites in the British Isles. Results suggest that the mires studieddo go through phases of being responsive to periodic forcing factors,with ca. 200, ca. 80 and 60-50 yr wavelengths reflected in some datasets. However, the patterns shown are not consistent. This could be theresult of local conditions at individual mires (human impact,sensitivity and vegetation succession) or of changes in the strength ornature of global forcing factors. Assessing a solar-mire link remainsdifficult because the century-scale variations of the Sun show differentintervals between solar minima, the durations of which are themselvesunequal, and because the proxy-climate data-sets from peat profiles maythemselves not be dated with sufficient precision and/or accuracy.Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."," 10.1002/jqs.596"," 2001"

During a 2-year period, serial ABRs were obtained on 143infants of 28 to 32 weeks' gestational age during the first postnatalweek. Waveforms were categorized on the basis of response replicabilityand the presence of waves III and V. Wave V latencies were also seriallyanalyzed when measurable for individual infants. Maturation of the ABRwas defined as abnormal when the waveform category worsened and/orlatency increased during the study interval. Serum albumin was analyzedat 48 to 72 hours of age in all patients. Serum TB was analyzed asclinically indicated. Aliquots of the same samples were also analyzedfor UB in a subset of infants.Results. The mean peak TB concentration (10.1 +/- 1.7 mg/dL) for the 71infants with normal ABR maturation was not significantly different fromthe mean peak TB (10.2 +/- 2.1 mg/dL) in the 24-hour period precedingthe ABR's first showing abnormal maturation in the other 55 infants.However, in infants with UB analyzed, the mean peak UB (0.62 +/- 0.20 vs0.40 +/- 0.15 mg/dL) was significantly higher in the infants withabnormal maturation (n = 25) than in infants with normal maturation (n =20). The B:A MR results were equivocal. In the entire study population,there was no difference in B:A MR between infants with normal versusabnormal ABR maturation. However, in the subset of infants in whom UBwas measured, although TB was not different, there was a significantdifference in B:A MR. Based on receiver-operating characteristic curves,a UB level of 0.5 mg/dL was the best discriminator with a sensitivity of70% and a specificity of 75%. The proportion of infants who had UB >0.5mug/dL and UB less than or equal to0.5 mg/dL and who had abnormal ABR,maturation was 0.81 and 0.33, respectively, with a significantdifference in the incidence of transient bilirubin encephalopathy amongthese 2 groups. The relative risk of abnormal ABR maturation with UB>0.5 mug/dL compared with UB less than or equal to0.05 mg/dL was 2.45(95% confidence interval: 1.33-4.49).Conclusions. UB is a more sensitive predictor than either serumbilirubin or B:A MR of abnormal ABR maturation, and hence transientbilirubin encephalopathy in premature newborns with hyperbilirubinemia."," 10.1542/peds.107.4.664"," 2001"

In this paper, variability ofphysico-chemical and biological parameters measured during two long-termexperiments (8 to 9 months) in uncontaminated outdoor freshwater lenticmesocosms (8 m(3)) is analysed. Consequences on the design ofecotoxicity tests in mesocosms and on data analysis are also addressed.Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and concentrationof suspended solids exhibited a very low variability whereas nutrientconcentrations displayed elevated levels of variability. Amongbiological parameters, those measured at the individual level were lessvariable than those measured at the community level. Functionaldescriptors frequently exhibited a lower inter-mesocosm variability thanstructural descriptors. Aggregation of data proved to significantlyreduce inter-mesocosm variability. The results indicate that univariatestatistical methods may be used for physico-chemical or species-level(e.g. biometric parameters) data which exhibit a moderate inter-mesocosmvariability. The use of multivariate techniques is suggested for otherlevels of investigation. Nevertheless, variability is not sufficient toidentify useful parameters.

A total offive duplication and deletion events were detected. These five eventsoccurred in three of the six lines, whereas the remaining three linescontained no detectable events.

Expression of the two candidate genesexamined is elevated over expression levels in the ancestral lines orthe lines without the duplication. In the two cases where theduplication at 2.85 Mb has been further characterized, the timing of thegenome reorganization is coincident with significant increases inrelative fitness.

One of the implications is acharacterization that verifies the sufficiency of the weightedscalarizing function, even for the non-convex case FDH. A linearizationof FDH is presented along with dual interpretations. Thus, aninput/output-oriented model is shown to be equivalent to a maximizationof the weighted input/output, subject to production space feasibility.The discussion extends to the recent developments: the freereplicability hull (FRH), the new elementary replicability hull (ERH)and the non-convex models by Petersen (1990).

This wascontrary to the popular belief that existed both within and outsidePakistan. The popular notions, which were related to constraints of anintegrated socio-technical system, illiterate farmers, social pressurefrom big landowners, and obstacles caused by the hierarchical society,were proven to be invalid under conditions of a participatory process ofsocial organization. The methodologies used had the common focus onbuilding self-reliance among the farmers, and using field training andother forms of capacity building as the major motivating influences. Afield implementation coordination committee consisting ofrepresentatives of all service delivery agencies working in the area,along with selected water users, highlighted the needed farmer-agencycoordination, and greatly facilitated an incentive mechanism throughcollaborative activities within the pilot sites. This combined effortsuccessfully achieved the formation of a number water users' associationat the tertiary (watercourse) level and a few water users' federations(WUFs) at the secondary canal (distributary) level at the selected pilotsites. The emerging results of this social experiment are encouraging.The new WUFs were able to take collective decisions to negotiate withstate irrigation authorities regarding joint management agreements(JMAs) for managing water resources in the canal system. Although theJMAs were not made immediately effective due to a procedural difficultyimposed by the present legal framework, the WUFs proceeded to test theircapacity in undertaking a planned maintenance programme during the canalclosure period, and also initiating a maintenance-related infrastructureimprovement programme. Replicability of this social organizationprogramme lies in the methodology adopted: the deployment of small fieldteams and the use of local volunteers. The step-wise social organizationprocess is meant to enhance sustainable interest of all the actorsinvolved. One drawback in the pilot efforts, however, has been the lackof full commitment from related government agencies, which have to takethe initiative for empowering the water users' organizations. However,both the enthusiasm and the capacity demonstrated by the water users insocial organization for collective action are considerable, and show agood potential for further progress. Very likely, the demand generatedat the local level could facilitate a process of bureaucraticreorientation, which in turn would provide the necessary institutionalsupport for the new water users' organizations.",NA," 2001"

Significantimprovements were seen in terminal TM/HBPC patients in HR-QoL scales ofemotional role function, social function, bodily pain, mental health,vitality, and general health. Team-Managed HBPC nonterminal patients hadsignificant increases of 5 to 10 points in 5 of 6 satisfaction with carescales. The caregivers of terminal patients in the TM/HBPC groupimproved significantly in HR-QoL measures except for vitality andgeneral health. Caregivers of nonterminal patients improvedsignificantly in QoL measures and reported reduced caregiver burden(P=.008). Team-Managed HBPC patients with severe disability experienceda 22% relative decrease (0.7 readmissions/patient for TM/HBPC group vs0.9 readmissions/patient for control group) in hospital readmissions(P=.03) at 6 months that was not sustained at 12 months.

It improved caregiver HR-QoL, satisfaction with care, andcaregiver burden and reduced hospital readmissions at 6 months, but itdid not substitute for other forms of care.

Since this paradigm has been the subject of several principalcomponents analyses, it is well qualified for confirmatory factoranalysis research. The current report builds on the substantialtheoretical knowledge and empirical data obtained from these structuralanalyses with a view to obtain further progress in the evolution of ourunderstanding of animal anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. The purposeof the present report was two-fold: (a) to test if the a pioriimposition of a 3-factor model, or a competing 2-factor elevatedplus-maze model, would fit our sample (n = 200 CD-1 mice) data in eachof two trials within an inferential confirmatory factor analyticframework; (b) provide a well-fitting model that confers indicatorvariables that can most effectively and parsimoniously measureunderlying constructs of elevated plus-maze behaviour. Multiplemodel-fitting criteria were used, and issues related to datanon-normality, outliers, replicability of the model, sampling error anderror of approximation ill the estimation of final model fit wereaddressed. The final 2-factor model, with estimated error covariancebetween two different pairs of indicator variables, was a good fit onthe trial-1 data, although it was necessary to allow unprotected stretchattends to non-significantly cross-load on factor-2. A 2-factor modelalso fit the trial-2 data from the present analysis, although it wasnecessary to allow closed arm time ratio to negatively cross-load onfactor-1. These results indicate that inferential hypothesis testing andmodel building procedures within a confirmatory factor analysisframework produces interpretable animal anxiety indices in the elevatedplus-maze. Moreover, a 2-factor, rather than a 3-factor model,parsimoniously and unambiguously explained the underlying constructs ofanxiety-like mouse behaviour in the elevated plus-maze in the presentstudy. Taken together, a reduction in the growing number of behaviouralindices reported in elevated plus-maze pharmacological studies issuggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The paper then explores the salient issues inthe principle of cost recovery. These are explored from the standpointof the financier and the borrower. It is pointed out that the financierhas obligations and responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. Thepaper then argues that awareness of obligations and responsibilitiesshould be accompanied by practices and procedures that institutionaliseand promote cost recovery. Regarding the borrowers the paper highlightsthe importance of their circumstances within the broader macro-economicsphere. It is then argued that the mode of cost recovery as reflected inthe terms of repayment should as much as possible suit the situation andrequirements of both the borrower and the lender. The discussion thenintroduces the role of ""outsiders"" in cost recovery and how politiciansand busybodies can frustrate the efforts of the financier to recoverfunds invested in housing. The implications of cost recovery are thendrawn out. In this case replicability and investor confidence areemphasised. The results of obsessions with cost recovery are alsooutlined. These points are then illustrated by examples from urbanlow-income housing in Zimbabwe. The study concludes by cautioning thatthe critical issues involved in cost recovery are not exclusivelyfinancial, technical and managerial. Most of the crucial issues relateinstitutional practices and procedures in the face of a multiplicity ofdirect and indirect stakeholders involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier ScienceLtd.

Traditionally,two alternative bill measures have been proposed: bill length measuredfrom the tip to skull (i.e., total culmen), mainly used in Europe, andbill length measured from the tip to the anterior edge of nostrils, usedboth in Europe and America. However, the correlation between bothmeasures as well as the analysis of what they are in fact measuring havenot been explored yet. The aim of this paper is to test in the CitrilFinch (Serinus citrinella) whether measurement of bill length from thetip to the anterior edge of nostrils and total culmen are measuringdifferent components of bill length (e.g., ramphotheca vs. premaxilla),and to assess which is the best measure in relation to their measurementerror. This is specially relevant in granivorous birds for which totalculmen length differs from ramphotheca length. The correlation betweenbill length to nostrils and total culmen was moderate (r = 0.75).Multiple regression of total culmen (dependent variable) on the billcomponents included ramphotheca length (R-2 = 52%) and marginallypremaxilla length to nostrils (R-2 change = 6%, P = 0.06). When usingbill length to nostrils as dependent variable it also includedramphotheca length (R-2 = 60%) and premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2change = 16%, P 0.001). Measurement error was low for bill length tonostrils (ME = 1.6%) but high for total culmen (ME = 26.3%), making thelatter measure not reliable. The replicability of total culmen isprobably decreased in granivorous birds, compared to other passerines,by the fact that in these species the abrupt edge of the ramphothecadiffers from the point at which the culmen meets the skull, whichhinders the location of the end of culmen. All of this highly recommendsthat, specially in granivorous birds, the length of bill should bemeasured from nostril. Our results also show that both bill lengthmeasures are mainly measuring ramphotheca.",NA," 2000"

We obtained serial BAERs on infants 28 to 32 weeks'gestation at birth, cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit of aregional referral center in Upstate New York. Waveforms were analyzedfor replicability and for the presence of waves III and V. Absolute andinterwave latencies were measured. Baseline and follow-up BAERmeasurements were compared, and the rates of change were calculated.Patient charts were reviewed for type of enteral feeding during theinterval between BAERs. Student's t test was used to analyze continuousvariables and chi(2) analysis was used to analyze categorical variables.Results. Data from 37 study infants (17 fed breast milk and 20 fedcommercial premature formula) revealed that there was no difference inabsolute latencies of waves III and V at baseline; however, the rates ofdecrease of absolute latencies over the study interval weresignificantly greater in infants receiving human milk.Conclusions. Infants fed breast milk have faster brainstem maturation,compared with infants fed formula, based on the rate of maturation ofBAERs. This effect may be attributable to the constituent composition ofbreast milk, compared with synthetic formulas."," 10.1542/peds.106.2.318"," 2000"

" J"," Fiedler, JL"," The Nepal National Vitamin A Program: prototype to emulate or donorenclave?"," HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING"," More than 250 million of the world's children suffer from vitamin Adeficiency. Nepal is one of 60 countries in which this deficiencyconstitutes a significant public health problem. Each year in Nepal,vitamin A deficiency is responsible for the deaths of 9000 children andfor 2500 children becoming permanently blind. The Nepal National VitaminA Program (NVAP) was begun in 1993 in eight of the country's 75districts. By the end of 1997, the programme covered 32 districts, andby 2003 its coverage will be nationwide.The Nepal NVAP is considered by many to be a highly successful, modelprogramme. It consists primarily of distributing high-dose vitamin Acapsules to all children 6 to 60 months of age during twice-yearlycampaigns. The capsule distribution is carried out by a previouslyexisting network of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) that hasbeen reinvigorated by the highly visible and universally acclaimedsuccess of the NVAP. An important strategy of the programme has been theempowerment of the FCHVs, which has been accomplished by organizing,training and motivating community workers and other representatives fromeducation, agriculture and other sectors, as well as politicalrepresentatives, to support the FCHVs.The annual cost of the NVAP is US$1.7 million. It costs $1.25 to delivertwo vitamin A capsules to each participant. The cost per averted deathis $327. The NVAP reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhoealdisease and measles, which in turn reduces the need for Ministry ofHealth services, thereby annually saving the Government of Nepal $1.5million. Factoring in these cost savings, the net annual cost of thecurrent NVAP is $167 000, and the net annual cost of the permanent,nationwide programme is estimated at $1.1 million. The NVAP is a highlycost-effective programme. The article concludes with a discussion of thesustainability and replicability of the programme."," 10.1093/heapol/15.2.145"," 2000"

Two of the model's interventionapproaches, tailoring to Stage-of-Change and creating completelyindividualized interventions; have already been developed andimplemented in previous research. A third intervention approach, inbetween stage-tailored and individualized, is targeting subtype groupswithin each Stage of Change. The subtype targeted intervention approachis in the initial development stage of empirically determining andvalidating the stage subtypes. Three studies are presented whichinvestigate stage subtypes within a representative sample of 4,144smokers in the Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation Stagesof Change. Within each Stage-of-Change study, two cluster analyses wereperformed using the Pros, Cons, and Situational Temptations from theTranstheoretical Model to establish cluster replicability. Clustersolutions were externally validated using the 10 Processes of Change and2 smoking behavior variables. Four distinct subtypes were found inPrecontemplation and Contemplation, and five subtypes were found inPreparation. These subtypes closely replicate subtypes previously foundin a convenience sample of smokers and provide strong evidence for theexistence of subtypes within the first three Stages of Change.

Animal models are needed in whichthese deficits and recovery of the affected functions can beinvestigated. In the present study, the entorhinal area was chosen asthe target for lesioning and for assessing the lesion-induced deficitsin the Morris water maze. The entorhinal cortex is regarded as aninterface between the hippocampus and neocortex. Deafferentiating thehippocampus through entorhinal lesions impairs spatial learning. Theeffects of lesions, induced by either electrocoagulation (experiment 1)or ibotenate excitotoxicity (experiment 2), on spatial orientationbehaviour were investigated. Water maze performance after unilateral orbilateral ibotenate injections into the entorhinal cortex was studied inthe third experiment. In an additional study, the replicability of thespatial learning deficit after lesions induced by bilateral injectionsof ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex was assessed by comparingthe results of nine experiments. We found that spatial learning wasimpaired after bilateral lesions aimed at the entorhinal cortex. Theelectrolytic lesion technique produced a relatively large sham effect,whereas the excitotoxic lesioning method did not. Unilateral injectionsof ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex did not affect spatialnavigation. The ibotenate induced lesions replicably produced deficitsin the Morris tasks. The degree of the induced spatial learningimpairments and the effects on the rate of acquisition during training,however, differed between experiments. This result suggests that thefundamental biological diversity between shipments of rats can accountfor variation in the effects of parahippocampal damage on spatiallearning even in highly standardized experimental set-ups.Rats lesioned by bilateral injections of ibotenic acid into theentorhinal cortex provide an interesting and reliable model forinvestigating cognitive dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases,stroke or traumatic brain injury.

To verify replicability ofprevious findings we also tested animals with Fx lesions on the sametask. Lesions limited to dorsal HPC were followed by impairment. Incontrast, lesions limited to ventral HPC resulted in enhanced learning.In agreement with previous data, Fx lesions also resulted in enhancedacquisition. We hypothesize that the effect of dorsal HPC lesions isrelated to interference with spatial learning, while the effect ofventral HPC and Fx lesions suggest increased AMG control of behavior. Wepropose that competitive interaction for behavioral output may takeplace between AMG and HPC memory systems at the level of nucleusaccumbens.",NA," 2000"

E."," All D-amino acid peptides prevent fetal death in a mouse model of fetalalcohol syndrome"," Society for Neuroscience Abstracts"," Naturally occurring proteins and peptides have L-conformation. TheD-conformation peptides have a potential benefit of enhanced stabilitydue to their resistance to peptidases. Here we report that peptidessynthesized with all D-amino acids are able to prevent fetal death in amouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The 9 amino acid peptide(SAL) is from activity dependent neurotrophic factor and the 8 aminoacid peptide (NAP) from activity dependent neuroprotective protein.Previously we reported that these peptides in the natural,L-conformation were potent protectors of in utero alcohol-induced fetaldamage (Soc. for Neurosci 1999;25:1009). We chose a model for FAS basedon an acute high exposure to alcohol that provided an outcomeemphasizing the severity of alcohol-induced growth restriction and fetaldeath (Neurobehav Tox.1980 2, 227). For accurate replicability ofalcohol and peptide administration we chose a model utilizingintraperitoneal injection. We chose the highest alcohol dose in themodel (0.03ml/kg) for the most severe test of efficacy. Pregnant C57Bl6Jmice were injected (IP) on gestational day 8 with 25% alcohol or vehiclewith and without D-NAP and D-SAL. Animals were evaluated on gestationalday 18. The fetal demise rate was higher in the alcohol (n=44, 37+-6%)than control (n=44, 7+-2%, P<.001) litters. D-NAP+D-SAL pretreatmentresulted in a fetal death similar to control (n=10, 6+-2%, P=1) andsignificantly less than alcohol (P<.001). A combination of all D-aminoacid ADNF-like peptides prevented alcohol-toxicity suggesting that thesepeptides may be of value in the treatment of conditions in whichoxidative stress is involved.",NA," 2000"

Proceedings of a Workshop held in Baoshan, Yunnan Province,China, March 2-5, 1999"," This paper describes the process of a community-based energy planningand management activity that was tested and implemented under the Peopleand Resource Dynamics Project in the Yarsha Khola watershed in Nepal.The eight main components of the activity identified during programmeimplementation are described: (1) entry into the community; (2)community mobilization and confidence building; (3) interaction withdistrict level line agencies for micro and macro linkages; (4)understanding the energy consumption patterns and the technologiesemployed; (5) assessing the availability of energy resources; (6)balancing energy consumption and resource availability; (7) examinationof the suitability of renewable energy technologies (RETs); and (8)implmentation of selected RETs. The paper examines the issue ofreplicability and sustainability of the approach in the context ofmountain communities and identifies the key issues learned duringprogramme implementation. It is concluded that the community-basedenergy planning and management approach is an effective mechanism foridentifying the problems, priorities, needs, and aspirations ofcommunities, and the presence of a research facilitator helpscommunities to solve problems by themselves.",NA," 2000"
